✅ Trip Verified | Tried booking 3 tickets on Air Canada website which said an error has occurred. My card was charged but I did not receive a valid ticket number. The reservation temporarily appeared but also later disappeared off my account. No response from Air Canada - where is my tickets or my money? I tried calling and emailing Air Canada with no response.;"""No response from Air Canada""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Business Class with my wife from Dubai to Miami via Toronto. Arrived in Miami on 22nd December 2022 but Air Canada had lost both of our bags. We completed a lost bags form and were told we'd be contacted within 24hrs. Problem was that we were going on a cruise to the Caribbean departing on 24th December. On 23rd December the bags were no where in sight so we made the decision to go and buy new clothes. Three days into the cruise we were told by Air Canada that our bags had arrived in Sao Paolo. When we checked in at Miami airport to return to Dubai our bags were given back to us. I have registered a compensation claim as we spent USD 3k on new clothes and luggage but received no response. I will never ever travel with Air Canada again. ;"""we spent USD 3k on new clothes""";"1

✅ Trip Verified |  Air Canada is the only airline flying non-stop from North America to Bangkok and this route appears to be a winner for them. The flight left on time late in the day and arrived in the early morning. Standard pod-style seating in the business class which allows one to sleep comfortably on this long (almost 16 hour) flight. Meals were very good, an area in which AC has made significant strides. I opted not to have a large meal immediately after take-off, but rather after sleeping, which was accommodated. This airline has an excellent selection of films in a number of different languages and from a variety of countries. Cabin crew was attentive. All in all, a very positive experience.;"""a very positive experience""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bereavement Policy is a scam. First sentence of their bereavement policy is ""Our bereavement policy offers reduced fares and the flexibility you need during a difficult time."" But when I called customer support after I booked through bereavement policy they said they do not guarantee the lowest rate for bereavement fare. It's disgusting that I have to provide all this info to them (death certificate, info on funeral) and what do I get? An extra bag of peanuts for my troubles? I'm flying to Halifax instead of my actual destination of Charlottetown as it is $1000 round trip vs $1800 and then I look up a rates for round trip to Halifax on my own afterwards and what do you know $900, all the same days.";"""Bereavement Policy is a scam""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Consistently no coffee on flights. This is not the first time it happening, I would say In my last 10 trips I have only been given coffee once. The more frustrating part is you are told “coffee maker is broken” or “we are brewing a fresh pot and will get back to you” never to receive or be offered an alternative. It’s frustrating, if you are not going to provide it just say so! Secondly, I was charged for a seat that I did not order, but couldn’t receive my boarding pass without paying for it, told to apply for the $ return online and given a website. Did so, received an acknowledgement that the request received and then that was it. probably costs about .30 cents to provide your customer a coffee, and to charge for a seat is ridiculous in the first place, but who knows maybe my $40 will break your bank Air Canada.;"""Consistently no coffee on flights""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Air Canada from Montreal  to Bridgetown via Toronto. Normally I don’t really recommend flying with Air Canada but in this case I really enjoyed it. Total flight time including connections was around eight hours but everything went smooth. The flight attendants were very nice and caring. The food selection was very broad and surprisingly for the first time ever there was no delays on both flights. at the end, I really enjoyed our family time in Barbados. If you want to take it easy flights, I recommend flying with Air Canada.;"""I really enjoyed it""";"

This is not the Air Canada of yesteryear; this felt like a brand-new airline.

Not Verified | Poor service paid $300 CAD for an extra baggage and the ticket price was $2000 CAD for one way flight. Flight was connected with Emirates flights delayed from Dhaka when my wife arrived at Dubai airport at Terminal 3. She can not see her flight number on the screen. After asking Emirates they told me that she need to go Terminal 1. There was nobody from Air Canada to give her any kind of instruction. After calling Air Canada customer service number they told me they are not physically present there they can not help my wife. Worst service and we will never take Air Canada in my life.;"""never take Air Canada""";"

Not Verified |  I would like to share with you the lack of service from the flight from Toyko to Toronto. The flight was so cold we needed three blankets and we were still freezing. People were waiting hats and winter coats on board. Also when we arrived at Toronto airport we waited for over an hour and 45 minutes for our luggage to come through. Air Canada have clearly lost your capability of servicing customers and your organizational skills are appalling. Would never travel with Air Canada again.

"Not Verified | I consider myself a patriotic Canadian, I always tried to fly Air Canada because I wanted to support our national airline even if it costed me few $$$ more than the other choices. I write this with great deal of pain that my flying experience with Air Canada in the recent past has been nothing but disappointing. My most recent trip to England (Jan 18th to 30th) for a family tragedy was the last straw. I will try to avoid flying Air Canada unless there is no other choice! My experience from start to end was very disappointing. The service on the plane was bare minimal. The food was horrible. I went to the back of the plane to use the washroom and spoke to the staff, I mentioned how bad the food was, I said people feed their pets better food than what we had, the buns were like plastic (I noticed most of the buns went to the garbage because people didn't/couldn't eat them, staff was very sympathetic, one of them nodded and said ""you should complain because they (AC management) don't listen to us"". On my return flight I had a layover in Toronto. They didn't offer anything let alone the garbage food they served on previous flights. They were even trying to sell the lousy earphones that would cost then no more than few pennies. They treated me as a domestic flyer despite they charged me over $1600 for a flight that should cost no more than $1000.";"""service was bare minimal""";"

The customer service rep was incredible, she was able to assist me, after I tried to do it myself for over an hour online. This was the best customer service experience I have ever had from any airlines. This representative did what I couldn't do in a couple of minutes.

"✅ Trip Verified | Air Canada left us with a horrendous ending to an otherwise amazing vacation. Flight out of Cancun at 2pm was cancelled last minute due to ""maintenance issues"". Got rebooked on a ""9pm"" flight that didn't end up departing until 10:45pm after waiting over an hour on the tarmac. The AC rep at Cancun also booked us on the late 9:45pm flight out of Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie stating ""there was no earlier flight"". We later found out that was a lie when 2 other friends booked the 2:10pm flight from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie, after the lady told us there were no other flights. We then arrive in Toronto at 2am thinking there would be AC reps waiting for us to get hotel vouchers and meal vouchers, no one at any AC rep desks until 4am when we finally got hotel and meal vouchers. You only get 20 dollar meal vouchers for the entirety of the next day, when our flight wasn't until 9:45pm. Not to mention, you can only use them at the airport, where a coffee will run you roughly 10 dollars. They also had no idea where we had to go to catch the shuttle to our hotel. Fast forward to the next day, we spend hundreds of dollars on breakfast lunch and dinner, all uncompensated before finally arriving to the airport around 8pm for our 9:45pm flight. We walk into the airport just in time to receive an email from AC stating our flight has been cancelled for a 3rd time now due to ""crew shortages"" this time. Again, we get our hotel and meal vouchers from thr AC rep. They again tell us we will not be compensated for meals outside of the airport before giving us another measly 20 dollars in terrible overpriced airport food. We are booked on a 11:15am flight tomorrow now, but I'm sceptical it gets out due to AC incompetence. Update: flight was in fact delayed until 2:30pm. I advise anyone wanting a pleasurable flying experience to steer clear of this airline.";"""steer clear of this airline"" ";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Air Canada in flight crew could have shown a bit of human decency but did not. We flew Victoria-Vancouver-Toronto-Miami. Victoria to Vancouver was delayed as was Vancouver to Toronto. This put us into Toronto an hour and a half late, cutting our connecting flight time to Miami in half (significant when you have to go through security and customs). We spoke to two attendants on the flight about this, both said they would check and neither of them got back to us. We were also seated at the back of the plane (Air Canada changed our seats at the last minute) so it took forever to just get off the plane, leaving us to run and scramble through the airport. Our plane was loading as we were at security. If flight attendants were decent (no extra work required) they could have asked passengers who did not have connections to remain seated while those that had tight connections left the plane. This would have given us an extra 15 to 20 minutes, and would have relieved the stress. We did make the plane just before the gates closed but only because passengers at customs let us through. No help from any flight personnel. Economy travellers are treated like cattle;"""Economy travellers are treated like cattle""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely rude staff. The air hostess attending us screamed at my autistic son for making her go aside as she was blocking his screen. He wasn't given any meals/food, we had booked the tickets with a fruit platter for my son. In a journey where as a parent I was super anxious about how my son would do, he was made to feel bad and not taken care of. The air hostess in question leaned over to talk to a passenger sitting beside us blocking my son's TV screen twice. And shouted at him twice when he tried to move her away. We were in the last seats of the middle row. There's aisles on either side, she could've gone to the other side and catered to that passenger or someone else coming down on that side could have assisted him. The staff was obsessed with having our seats upright.;"2Extremely rude staff""";"

Not Verified |  I am a Super Elite 2 Million Miler with Aeroplan/Air Canada. Waiting for 2 hours only one of our 3 bags arrived. The AC baggage customer service employee at Pearson Terminal 1 confirmed, looking at the tracking system screen, our 2 bags were left in Montreal. According to his instructions I filed a report. Luckily, we waited for additional 15 minutes and the two bags arrived. Speaking to him again, he reconfirmed that the system is showing the bags were still in Montreal. He turned the screen to prove it to me, I could not see any proof that the bags were still in Montreal. Clearly, he did not know how to navigate the tracking system. We were lucky but there must be thousands of unlucky people left the airport.

Not Verified |  Stunning incompetence and disregard for comfort, dignity and people's time. I have NEVER had an Air Canada flight that was anything less than painful. Between having to wait on the tarmac for more than an hour for both of my flights this trip, to them being unable to unload passengers at the end for unknown reasons, to our baggage not being made available for nearly an hour on the carousel. It is extremely difficult to be anything less than intensely frustrated. I will never fly air Canada again.

Then it was canceled and they announced to adjust the passengers on AC 1658 leaving at 4.40 pm, which eventually delayed untill 5.15 and then it took off.

Not Verified |  Coming back from Yellowknife made it to Toronto. Flight to the Soo was cancelled 3 times due to, according to Air Canada, no ground crew in the Soo. $20 voucher issued to each of us - about enough for a coke and bag of chips at airport prices. Luggage situation was ludicrous after having checked our bags then having to spend hours to retrieve them with each cancelation. Hotel room was offered for us (2 adult males) with one queen bed.

Not Verified |  The flight was delayed by 8 hours at Copenhagen. Air Canada provided updated ETA for departure three times. After third time of further delaying the flight, they announced food voucher, which was 100DKK (about $19CAD). This amount was insufficient to buy a food from a restaurant at the airport. There was no other compensation by Air Canada to the passengers suffering the extremely uncomfortable stay at the gate lounge. Due to this delay and unclear communication, I missed a critical meeting at work (estimated arrival was at 2:45PM ET, and my meeting was at 4PM for client year end review) and it has severely impacted my work. My wife and children also got impacted due to the extreme stress they had to go through, with minimal support from the Air Canada staff.

✅ Trip Verified |  My agent arranged flights with United Airlines and Air Canada for November 1, 2022. Twice my flight were cancelled. Neither time my flight was rescheduled, nor did the airlines notify me. On October 11, I called Air Canada to ask which gate I should arrive at. They told me that my flight had been cancelled on Sept. 12. Had I not contacted Air Canada about departure information, I would not have known. I spent hours with both airlines in the next two days. I was charged another $163 from Air Canada. I had to purchase new flights to Winnipeg. United told me I was due a refund of $26, and refused to give it to me. I informed both United and Air Canada that only I be allowed to make any further changes. They agreed. On October 31, my agent emailed me. She stated my entire, original $805 United/Air Canada charge was disputed by me. It was not. Once again, I had to call the airlines to confirm that her allegations were incorrect. Once again, much more wasted time and stress. Again, on October 31, less than 13 hours before my departure, my agent cancelled my flights with United and Air Canada. The airlines never informed me. They allowed my agent to cancel the flights that I made on October 11, despite their assurances that they would not be allowed to intervene. I spent hours again on the telephone hours before departure hoping that I would be allowed to depart. This new flight resulted in a three hour earlier departure, with an extra stop in Chicago. On November 1, I had to spend more of my vacation time trying to arrange another flight home. These airlines have caused me many, many hours of work, stress and extra expenses. This has been a pitiful experience for me. They have nearly sabotaged my entire $8000 trip to Churchill, Manitoba. I believe that I am eligible for compensation and refunds. ;"""nearly sabotaged my entire $8000 trip""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Air Canada completely ruined my holiday. I flew from Zurich to Charlotte via Toronto. In Charlotte, my bag did not arrive. It finally was delivered three days later. Christmas ruined. I bought another bag and returned to Zurich via Toronto. This time, both bags did not arrive. One bag was delivered a day later and the other one, two days later is still missing. New Years plans ruined. This is only a fraction of the entirely miserable experience I’ve had going back for months since I first booked. Repeated flight changes and cancelations, a forced overnight stay in Toronto (nothing to due with weather) and constant re-booking of hotels and rental cars. Customer service is almost none existent. And often literally non existent. I don’t know what is going on with Air Canada but this is shocking. And somehow just very, very sad for all involved.

✅ Trip Verified | Air Canada is out of control! The organization has lost complete control of its Labour. The airline staff, the baggage handlers, the ticket agents. In this past week, December 23rd I flew from Vancouver to Toronto. Mother Nature had wreaked weather havoc across the country, Delays were expected and very much understandable. Many flights were cancelled by all airlines across the country 21 + 22 December. When I arrived at YVR for my flight on December 22 I was pleasantly surprised had our slightly delayed flight was indeed going to go today, in fact, Air Canada had organized four 777 aircraft including mine, to consolidate many of the affected customers. All four of these aircraft were departing for Toronto within an hour. So, after further delays, (2 more hours on the tarmac) we took off for Toronto. We arrived on the runway at 11:30pm, 4 hours after the original schedule l, but all too given the weather. Now the fun begins For the next 5 hours we sat on the plane, on the runway. With no updates or information we all just sat waiting. The airline staff would not serve us as much as a bottle of water. A gentleman behind me asked for some nuts several hours into the wait, told that everything was closed up. The airline staff, although being paid of course, were off duty as far as serving the customers! They did absolutely nothing for the customers, not even in Business class where we pay excessive rates, could we get a bottle of water during a 5 hour sit on the runway! A few days later Now December 27th, I am again on Air Canada flight in business class, Toronto to Doha to begin my journey back to Thailand. I have a 3 hour layover in Doha to connect to Bangkok. The airport (Terminal 3 Predominantly Air Canada) in complete complete chaos! Cannot even get to your boarding gates. Anyhow I do finally fight my way through the Air Canada customer crowds to get to my plane. As I sit in my seat, I receive a 35 minute delay notification from Air Canada. A while later I receive another 30 minute delay notice followed by a 15 and a 25. This goes on for 3 hours! Now I know my connection in Doha is As good as a gone. After take off I approach the In Charge to ask what happens now with me missing my connection l. I am advised to contact customer support after I arrive in Doha. Does anyone realize how long you wait to contact Air Canada customer support? Hours and hours if at all during their current spiral into Chaos! So bottom line, I am shot out of luck! Had to purchase another ticket! Sat in Doha airport sleeping on a bench for half day and Air Canada takes NO OWNERSHIP! And my final point to the readers, this 3 hour delay was due to shortage of baggage staff! This is the update the In Charge shared with me! They don’t have enough staff! Therefore they cannot get the planes loaded with your baggage on schedule! Have a look at the fields of baggage all over Pearson! It’s out of control! Don’t take the very high risk of flying with Air Canada You will be sorry you did;"""Air Canada is out of control""";"

"✅ Trip Verified | Stay away from Air Canada if you can! This company has been dropping the quality of its service over the years. And every year it seems to get worse! The customer support line is horrible and you have to stay hours on the phone to get a hold of somebody. Good luck if you're late to a connecting flight or lost your luggage in a foreign country with Air Canada. You're pretty much on your own! Let's not forget about the incredibly complicated system to report a problem or request a refund after the fact. I feel that they do this on purpose to make it complicated so you give up on the refund. In addition, Air Canada is doing everything it can to take away your money. Until recently, you could take two 32 kg bags to countries with long routes, now it's a 23 kg bag and an absurd price to carry an additional bag. Air Canada does not care about you. I've had multiple experiences where my flight got delayed, they took 1.5 to 3 hours to pick up the phone when I needed it the most, left me stranded in foreign countries, cancelled the flight minutes before it should have left, not allowed me to board because of a simple name mistake that they took long to fix, deflecting ownership when tickets got purchased from other reputable websites, lack of seat or cabinet space due to overbooking, insane delays while leaving the Toronto airport, lack of communication between employees, and lack of of flight availability in connections. Do I need to go on? Do we all get the point? It's a shame for a company of this size and past reputation to get to such low standards. I've been traveling since I was a kid and I've always liked Air Canada. I always felt like I was ""at home"" when traveling with Air Canada. Nowadays, just remembering the name makes me angry because of the negative things the company did to me. Shame on Air Canada for firing thousands of their staff. This is one of the reasons why they are struggling to keep up with the customer needs. This goes to show how the leadership team at Air Canada are unprepared for the job and don't care about their customers or the company reputation. All they care about is their big fat bonuses at the end of the year. I really hate writing reviews but I felt an obligation to do so given the horrible service and after what the bad service they provided to me. Again, stay away from Air Canada if you can.";"""every year it seems to get worse!""";"

Not Verified | I have been stuck inside of Vancouver for three and a half days since December 24th of 2022 with no luggage. From the beginning I have been traveling with my family to visit my sister, brother-in-law, nephew and new-born niece. I have not been able to get in contact with my baggage since I have arrived, along with my family as well. However it is December 27th now and I have been able to receive all of our luggage. They have been left unattended outside as we got our bags back soaked from the rain and cold from the snow. Air Canada has been a horrible experience the entire journey through delayed and cancelled flights to losing hundreds of thousands of bags. Only a handful of the staff in baggage claim in the yellow vests were a major help in us retrieving the rest of our bags for a happy holiday vacation. This comment is solely appreciation towards them.;"""staff in baggage claim were a major help""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Air Canada is really struggling to be bearable. Upon landing at Pearson, it was announced overhead 3 times with apologies that my Tokyo Narita flight had moved to another carousel (quite far away). All passengers migrated to new carousel according to announcement. Ultimately no luggage arrived and had been delivered to the previous original carousel (without announcement). The bags had been removed by airport staff and set aside (with hundreds of others). The passengers became irate at the baggage men. Baggage men instructed passengers that this is not them but rather it’s always Air Canada who is incompetent. The staff on this flight had terrible attitude and looked like they hated their jobs and lives. Always avoid Air Canada whenever possible. If they were not a federal government backed (near) monopoly they would never survive in the real world. Canadians need to allow Air Canada to fail without bailout so a new competitive travel market can replace it;"""staff on this flight had terrible attitude""";"

When I checked in to my flight from Frankfurt, the automated system checked me into my current flight and the next flight that was scheduled to Indianapolis. Indianapolis was canceled, but I was not checked out of the flight. Since I was not off-boarded the replacement flight is there but I can't check in because I was not off-boarded from the original flight. Sadly the check-in crew at the airport can't figure this out and tell me I have to speak with reservations. Reservations are over the phone only and they are not answering the phone. 24 hour later, I finally spoke to reservations and they informed me only check-in at the airport can off-board me from the original flight, they can only get me a rescheduled flight after check-in off-boards me from the original flight. The only way to speak to check-in is to stand in the line with people checking their baggage, so you stand in line for an hour or more. Then check-in says I'm off-boarded, reservations says I'm not. And they don't talk to each other. So I have to wait in the at bag check line for the 3rd time to tell them I am not off boarded. Finally get it straightened out, start checking into flight and it gets canceled. This was the first of 4 different flights to get scheduled and canceled. My daughter finally drove 10 hours to Toronto, Canada to pick me up. I did not know and Air Canada did not tell me that I needed a reference # from baggage at the airport. I was escorted 3 times into the international carousel area looking for my bag, someone could have mentioned this? Since I do not have this # I cannot put in a request for lost baggage on-line. And of course the customer support line for lost baggage is not taking calls. I understand this was weather related, but with some planning and an all hands on deck mentality, this could have been a tolerable experience for customers instead of a nightmare.;"""their plan is no information for customers""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I am very disappointed with my experience with Air Canada. I had a flight booked for 5am on Boxing Day from Halifax to Toronto with a planned layover before heading to Vancouver. My flight was cancelled the night before due to a stated lack of crew members. I was told via text that Air Canada would be contacting me with alternative routes shortly - this never happened. Not only did Air Canada not contact me with alternate routes, but they did not make it clear at all that the only way to get rescheduled was to call in to their call center - which at the time of the cancellation was so busy that they would not even put me on hold. I woke up at 6am the next morning and headed to the airport myself to speak to Air Canada staff, where I was told to call their customer service line as they could do nothing about bookings. After multiple call attempts I was put through to an agent - who told me that there had been a flight from Ottawa to Vancouver - but that I had been too late. Meaning Air Canada could have made the arrangements to save my flight and did not. Air Canada then gave me a flight that would land in Vancouver three days later than expected, stating it was the earliest flight. I just called again to try and rebook and was on hold for over an hour. When the music stopped - there was a blank pause and I was hung up on. I have never had a worse experience with a business in my life.  This is an example of terrible customer service, unclear communication, and disorganization.;"""terrible customer service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We began our journey with Air Canada on the Wednesday before Christmas. My boyfriend and I had planned to fly into Montreal as it is one of the closest airports to my childhood home. We wanted to have a nice dinner and do some sightseeing in Montreal before heading continuing our journey home for the holidays. We were scheduled to land in Montreal on that Wednesday night around 6:30 PM EST. We were delayed 3 different times, now making our departure from Tampa around 8 PM EST. During the boarding process Air Canada’s computer software needed to be restated and all passports had to be manually typed into their system. Because boarding took so long, we were now not leaving until about 8:45 PM EST. As my boyfriend and I were sitting in our seats waiting to taxi out to the runway, the captain came on and told the plane “The wing has been damaged. We are not sure if we will be able to fly or if it can be fixed. Well let you know as soon as possible”. We waited at the gate, with little to no communication from the airline crew for over 2 1/2 hours. At one point I walked back to use the airplane restroom and one of the stewardesses was laying down across the empty row of seats trying to sleep. We finally left Tampa after 11 PM EST and arrived in Montreal after 3 AM EST. We were scheduled to fly out of Montreal back to Tampa on the 26th of December. Christmas morning I received the email from Air Canada informing me it was time to check into our flight home. When I put in the reference number the email provided me, I kept getting a message that said “Sorry we are unable to process your request at this time”. I knew something was wrong since the tickets in my Air Canada app were now missing. We both called Air Canada and waited on the phone for over 4+ hours before speaking to a person. Air Canada informed us that our trip was canceled by them because we had “no showed” for our initial flight to Montreal. I have two claim numbers for the initial flight to Montreal for reimbursement for being delayed 9+ hours, and I have receipts from the food that we bought on the flight there. Our passports were scanned 3 separate times by Air Canada personnel. When we said that this incident caused by Air Canadas personnel was a huge breach of Canadas National security, they simply agreed as if it was not a big deal. You can’t let people on a plane without knowing who they are! Air Canada told us it was our fault that we had missed the flight, even though we have proof we were on the flight. They informed us that they would not be looking at the information to prove we were on the initial flight and that they would not be helping us get home to Tampa. We were on our own. They would not help pay for meals, food, or travel that would be necessary over the next couple of days due to their lack of accountability. We spent our entire Christmas Day on the phone with Air Canada to be told, we’re screwing you over and we’re not going to do anything about it or help you at all. Merry Christmas to everyone except Air Canada.;"""not going to do anything about it or help you""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight experience I have had. My flight has already been cancelled twice due to weather conditions when other planes flying to Vancouver the same time as me are able to somehow board and take off. During my second rebooked flight, I went to the airport, was notified of a 4 hour delay, and after waiting the full 4 hours plus the 2 hours it takes me to go through checkin and security, they announce the flight is cancelled. I then have to line up in customer service for more than 8 hours just to claim my baggage and rebook a ticket. No hotel accommodations of any sort whatsoever and my next flight is booked 4 days later! Not to mention customer service closes at 11:30pm and there were hundreds of people in line behind me who are potentially unable to claim their baggage at all. The staff is incredibly disorganized with many staff not able to provide up to date information as they are not informed as well. There is no way of rebooking cancelled tickets online or through phone (as Air Canada is not taking calls), the only way is to stand in line for hours at an airport with no guarantee of possibly any rebooking at all as all the flights are overbooked. It’s absolutely disgusting how Air Canada treats their customers.;"""Worst flight experience I have had""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible experience. Flights canceled ""due to weather"". But actually because ground crews are understaffed. They say they will rebook you, no just stand in one long line after another to find out they've already canceled your trip. Sure you can get a refund. But your stuck half way to your destination. Airlines need to build margins Into their schedules and not greedily pack out every flight. Otherwise peoples flights who get canceled literally have no way to get to their final destination.

Not Verified |  Worst experience flying I have had. Multiple flight cancellations, left stranded at the airport, no one at the information desk, and it takes an average of 2 hours on hold for anyone to pick up the phone from customer service. No respect for anyone’s time from Air Canada. My flight from Detroit to Toronto was delayed multiple times, it was canceled and no one at the front desk could help, all they could offer was “call Air Canada”. After being on hold for an hour and 45 mins, someone could finally be bothered to pick up the phone. The best they could offer was a flight the next morning. My original flight was at 6AM. They didn’t offer me any accommodation and I would be spending over 24 hours at the airport. Fine. I wait. Only for the next morning to roll around and they messed up the booking so my connection takes off before i get there. Another 2 hours on hold before i can talk to someone at “customer service”. Then they put me on a flight to Seattle to make it to Vancouver that same day. I arrive at Seattle and flight to Vancouver has been cancelled and moved to the next day. Currently still on hold with Air Canada. Tried talking to the guy at the kiosk but he was “busy” and then he just left. If you value your time (at this point I’ve wasted 2 of my vacation days at airports and on hold), and your money. If you want to be treated with respect don’t book Air Canada. ;"""Multiple flight cancellations""";"

Not Verified | If you want to have a timely trip to your destination, then pick another airline. Air Canada painstakingly delayed our flight by 20 minutes intervals every hour. Once we finally boarded the flight, we had to sit on the plane for an additional two hours “waiting for fuel”. If you want your bag to arrive to your final destination, pick another airline. After years of flying, I’ve never not received my luggage. Second time flying air Canada - they had a personal goal to change that. Thanks Air Canada.

✅ Trip Verified |  Last night and - still ongoing today, I had the worst trip with Air Canada. First flight from Boston was delayed and they told us 2 hours before, arrived to Canada rushing to make the connection flight when they told me that flight has been canceled, due to crew constraints. They lost my luggage, rescheduled a full day. Between looking for luggage and rescheduling, I waited from 7 pm to 1:30 am to be able to leave the airport to the hotel. I arrive the next day and that next flight is also delayed (2 hours before departure) because of pilot scheduling issues, as if they just found out about this trip. Super inconsiderate for people's limited vacation time. I got this ticket months in advance calculating my vacation days just so I can spend them at airports, baggage claims and desk assistance. Theres also no one to call, and they consider themselves not responsible for these cancelations/ delays because I booked with a booking agency. Safe to say I will never travel with Air Canada again.;"""the worst trip with Air Canada""";"

Other delayed flights were able to leave but Air Canada decided to cancel our flight. No hotel provided no food or drink voucher. Air Canada employees are rude and not helpful all they say were ""there's nothing we can do to help"". I was rebooked for the next day at 7:30pm. I was forced to check in my carry on luggage by this white girl she said that my luggage was too big. I flew the day before from SFO to Winnipeg and never had a problem with my carry on luggage. She was really rude and rolling her eyes at me saying to the other staff loudly so I could hear her ""How do you think they will react if we start charging them for their luggage"" then gave me a very nasty look. I waited for hours to pick up my luggage at the baggage claim. We were not allowed to leave because if we do they wont let us back in. I didn't eat or drink since 9am because of all the run arounds Air Canada staff giving us.  I will never fly Air Canada again. You can really tell they do not care about their customers.

Travelling with child and infant without having cabin bag was disaster since lot of essential baby stuff was packed in it keeping in view a total of our 40hr long journe trying to find solution at Toronto airport for 2-3 hrs we didn't get any proper solution to retrieve our cabin bags.

Not Verified |  Terrible experience. My flight was delayed due to delay in fuelling the aircraft, two hours delay. As a result I missed my connecting flight to Montreal. Thankfully the connection flight was also Air Canada, and they automatically booked my to a next day flight. However, the problem is that they didn’t give me an option to choose which flight I wanted to get rebooked on, there was no need to book it for the next day as there was another Air Canada flight in 1.5 hours. They allowed other people to rebook to this 1.5 hours flight leaving same day, but they didn’t allow me, the reason they gave me was that they cannot transfer my luggage in 1.5 hours to this flight. How is it that in my earlier travels they have transferred my luggage with 45 minutes layover and they were not able to do this time in 1.5 hours. They had themselves decided which flight I should get rebooked on (in this case it was next day) and they weren’t ready to listen to any logical reasoning from customer. The lady at customer service was angry as to why I am not waiting in line, but she wasn’t listening to the fact that there were 50 people waiting in the line and if I waited the 1.5 hours flight would have been missed. She wasn’t listening to me at all, and calling my behaviour unacceptable and threatening to call security. I was in tears. I get it’s busy - all customer service workers are stressed but there was not once that I felt the customer service was acceptable.

✅ Trip Verified |  I specifically booked my last overseas flight to Canada on another airline, hoping to avoid Air Canada. Only after I paid was I informed that the 2nd and longest leg of my flight was operated by Air Canada.  None of my experience involves any delays or unexpected problems. It was a totally on schedule and uneventful flight. But the service on board is so atrocious. My husband and I, both Canadian and totally fluent in English, were constantly amazed at the rude behavior of every flight attendant on our side in economy class. Every simple and humble request for normal things like a cup of water, a blanket, were met with scorn and loud chastisements. The not-Canadian lady sitting next to me, who was extremely polite, was shocked at every interaction with the flight attendants.  Air Canada flight attendants have increasingly become the worst ambassadors for the country.  have flown all over the world with dozens of different airlines for the last 30 years, and can safely say that Air Canada has the rudest flight attendants I have ever experienced. Also, nobody seems to clean the bathrooms even on 17 hour flights.;"""service on board is so atrocious""";"

✅ Trip Verified | I was incredibly disappointed in this airline. The seats on this plane were incredibly squished together, small and absolutely not realistic for someone to sit in or get any sleep on a 15 hr flight. I know this is common among most airlines but it felt especially squished together more than I’ve experienced on other international flights. I noticed they added another seat to each row. I remember last time I travelled it was 2 on the window sides and 3 in the middle, I noticed that has changed from 3 on the window sides and 4 or 5 in the middle. Then to make things even worse the food was inedible. I’m not expecting a lobster meal or anything and I eat almost anything but that food was disgusting and also in unusual small portions. So not only couldn’t I sleep, stretch my legs out reasonably (causing cramping and pain) but I also hardly ate for 15 hrs. That is cruel to do to their passengers. And in order to get a situation with decent food and comfortable seating, you have to pay hundreds of dollars more. On my flight home from Auckland to Vancouver, there were two seats in front of me that we’re the first row with extra legroom compared to the other seats. Before take off I asked the stewardess if I could sit in those seats since they were empty and in a very snarky tone he told me that passengers pay extra for those and you have to do that ahead of time. I straight up told him I’ll pay for it and he said it was too late. When I was booking the flight that option was already taken so there is no way I could have booked it before hand. I sat for 15 hrs staring at these seats with reasonable leg room right in front of me for my whole flight and it was infuriating. They wouldn’t even let this poor single mom with a baby sit there. I believe making people live in these conditions on a 15 hr flight is cruel and I hope that Air Canada and other airlines change these elitist and exploitive practices of business.;"""incredibly disappointed in this airline""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased my ticket more than one month before the departure date. I am flying YUL-LHR on an Air Canada ticket (personal) and LHR-SIN on Singapore Airlines on a ticket purchased my by employer for business. At the check-in, I asked that my check-in luggage be tagged to my final destination (Star Alliance). The check-in clerk said no. He called his manager who also said no. Reason was a change of policy less than a month ago. No prior communication to customers and when I asked to clarify the policy, the clerk said I don’t know. So when I arrived to LHR I have to go through immigration and customs, pick up my luggage and go to the check in counter, security, etc. I will probably missed my connection.

They said I could request a voucher for my ticket and it would be processed in 8-10 weeks. I did it ahead of time knowing it would expire Dec 2022. Submitted in April. It's almost Dec. Now and they have not gotten back to me. I was able to just get them to rebook it over the phone. Then it was canceled and changed to a time that doesn't work for me. Along with that I had to book 2 other accompanying tickets. Website wasn't working so I called. After more than an hour of waiting I spoke to someone who spelled my name wrong so she had to cancel my whole booking. By the time she went to rebook, my original flight was $200 more per ticket. Said there wasn't anything they could do. Now I have a minor traveling alone because we already changed that ticket to match ours before they canceled. Or I dish out money I don't have for their mistake. Would not fly with them again if it wasn't for this pre existing ticket.;"""Would not fly with them again""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Scammed by booking a non-stop flight that actually had a connection: I checked the flight online and booked the ticket through Air Canada's customer service over the phone. Everywhere it was written that it's a direct, non-stop flight flight, both ways. Even the customer service representative did not give us any additional details. After boarding the flight, we found out that the flight actually has a connection through Sao Paolo (GRU) where we needed to get off, pass through airport security and board the aircraft again. The ticket and booking confirmation did not specify any of these details. To our dismay, there were people who would board the plane from those connections and get better seats where we never got the chance to select our seats again. If it were considered a legit connection as it should have been, then we may have been able to select better seats for some parts of the flight. I believe Air Canada did this intentionally to boost their flights ratings on search engines like Google Flight so that their flight shows up above other airlines' flights who actually show a stopover. They can also charge a higher price by claiming this to be a non-stop flight. This is essentially scamming the customers. Horrible food: Their food was also horrible as usual. The chicken sandwich was cold and stale. The food was so bad that on our way back, we actually had dinner at GRU airport. That return flight's food was actually worse. I had to ask for a different menu item because the pancakes were as dry as the Atacama Desert. Narrower seats: Since they cannot reduce the leg space further because then passengers will have to stand throughout the flight, they narrowed the width of the seats to fit at least one more seat in each row in the economy section. It was pretty much impossible to turn on your sides, do anything that required some mobility or even sleep properly. The most difficult exercise was eating. There was no room to keep your hands at the minimum angle required to even use knife and fork properly to cut and eat food. My photos show the evidence. Usually the food tray would have enough space for the meal tray and a cup. However, if you want to keep the meal tray properly, you won't get any space to put the cup and vice versa. Such a shame for a company that's Canada's flagship carrier and has monopoly over flight routes.;"""food was also horrible as usual""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We originally booked and paid for a direct flight to Barcelona, where we were to board a cruise ship. Air Canada cancelled that flight only 2 days after we paid for it, and bounced us around on at least 3 other non-direct routes, but never offered a refund for the lower priced tickets. This final flight, via Lisbon, had a 75 minute window to connect on Air Portugal flight 2676. About 24 hours prior to departure from Toronto, we received an email announcing that the flight from Toronto to Lisbon would be 45 minutes late leaving Toronto. Once in Lisbon, we found out that Air Portugal had a second flight to Barcelona about 2 hours later. Air Canada should have made that our connecting flight from the very start. With about 2 dozen fellow passengers from the Air Canada flight scrambling to get to Barcelona, that later Air Portugal flight was quickly full. We did not get tickets for that flight. There was absolutely NO Air Canada presence in the Lisbon Airport, and Air Portugal denied any and all responsibility to even assist us. More like “Star Non-Alliance” from our perspective. A Portugal police officer, stationed at the airport, was the only person who gave us assistance during our 17 hours stuck there. With the help of Holland America, we finally got a midnight flight to Malaga Spain and joined the cruise ship two days late. A loss of almost $2,000 for the two of us. Air Canada responded to my detailed inquiry with an unsigned form letter stating that the delay was not their fault. To me, it smacked of arrogance. Check out Air Canada’s FAQs on their web site. Read their definition of how they calculate a mechanical delay at the origin if it happens to subsequently coincide with a weather delay at the destination. It’s all about protecting Air Canada and denying any responsibility. I have long disliked this airline. Customer Service on the admin side is terrible. On the plane, it is not bad. Phone them and you are routinely on hold for an hour plus.;"""Service on the admin side is terrible""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  My girlfriend and I changed our booking prior to our flight and we have a reciept saying we should get 100 euros refund as a result of us changing the booking. We have waited 5 months so far and have not received a cent. We have contacted air Canada several times to ask where the money is at. The first time we were told it would arrive shortly. The second time we were thrown around between different people until we got hung up on out of nothing. The third time today I called in and asked where the money was at and now they say my name isn't even the one on the ticket and booking reference I've made. They refuse to receive my boarding pass and receipts which state that the ticket is of course mine. As to the actual experience flying with Air Canada I do not have anything positive to say.

Not Verified |  Just a horrible airline, very bad service, very expensive, old airplanes, dirty and fallen apart seats, rude staff. They need to learn from some airlines like Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways or even Aeromexico. My last trip with Air Canada was an embarrassment, they charged travelers a 1 cad for earphone and serving water from this dollars store 1.5 litre of water, very embarrassing. I misplaced my credit card and I only had my debit card on me and I wanted to pay for the earphone, the flight attendant handed them to me and proceeded to get the payment but apparently their payment system doesn't accept debit cards, so she told me that my payment wasn't accepted and asked me hand back the earphone. A nice lady behind was a witness to this surrealistic situation and paid for my earphones, I fly at least 3 times a year for many years and I always avoided Air Canada until then, to me its an airline from the stone age.;"""to me its an airline from the stone age""";"

Not Verified | My wife travelled from Chennai (India) to YYZ. I had few questions for customer support like the price for 2nd Baggage (as they have been charging for 2nd bag recently). Support informed 105 CAD, also I asked about 3rd baggage - she said its again same, so my wife took the 3rd baggage too and at airport she was asked  pay 300 CAD for second baggage. They also did not give an option to pay online which would have been less for me but at airport they have charged 8500 (142 CAD). This is total daylight robbery. I would never opt for Air Canada next time. Poor Support. Also another support person mentioned that passenger has to get second boarding pass at Frankfurt (transit) which gave me more panic. And that is again not true. Lufthansa issued both boarding pass at Chennai (MAA). Support is totally not aware of any of the airline policies and also they want to rob ppl at their throat. Total regret and got a bad impression from my wife during her first travel.;"""got a bad impression""";"

Not Verified |  This was our worst experience ever. Air Canada did not do its job well. The flight was just sitting on the runway for an hour at the Toronto airport. When we booked the flight and given the itinerary, it was just a 45 minutes technical stop over at London for which we were not required to offboard the aircraft. It was announced that we need to offboard and there is a lay over of 2.5 hours. We had to go through all the security checkins again. They did not start boarding until 25 minutes and then when we asked, they said it’s delayed for 2.5 hours due to technical issues. Again until 35 minutes before the scheduled time they did not start boarding. The staff at the gate did not have any clues about flight time. So many people missed connecting flight from Mumbai. Our bags did not arrive at Mumbai airport. Overall the whole flight experience was a big mess. Air Canada needs to show a responsible behavior and notify customers in advance if they already have such plans of extended pay over.;"""our worst experience ever""";"

Not Verified |  The absolute worst customer service. Will never fly with Air Canada again. We were going from Vancouver to Toronto and our flight was canceled a few hours before the flight and we were put on another flight 7 hours later, which meant we lost 7 hours of our vacation, 5 of us had taken days off work which we could have worked, by the time we reached rental cars were closed, we didn’t get the hotel rooms we had wanted, and missed some of your planned events for that day as got to the hotel at 5am. I have contacted air Canada several times via calls and email and received 1 computer email giving a percentage off the next flight within 2 years for 4 people (even though we were 5). I have been requesting to speak to a representative for 4 months and still have not heard back.;"""absolute worst customer service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a flight from Terrace CA to Zurich via Vancouver departure on the 17 September and arriving on 18 September. Flight number AC8440 (YXT to YVR) and AC882 (YVR to ZRH). While checking in at the airport in Terrace on 17 September we were told that the flight from Vancouver to Zurich has been canceled without upfront information. This resulted in the situation that we had to travel via Frankfurt to Zurich and arriving 10 hours later in Zurich as originally planned. In addition, we booked Economy Premium Seats for additional costs but were not delivered with Premium Seat class. I reached out to customer care on 17 September 2022 via Air Canada homepage, on customer care hotline on 24 October 2022 and via e-mail to customer care on 25 October 2022.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Charlottetown, PEI to Dallas via Montreal. My first experience was pretty good. My return flight was Dallas Fortworth to Charlottetown via Toronto Pearson Airport. My dallas flight experience was good. My troubles started when flight to Charlottetown from Toronto got delayed and later got cancelled. I received a message that my Charlottetown flight got cancelled. To know my options I approached a Air Canada personnel near the gate. That person suggested to contact Customer relations on Level 2 near escalators. I waited in que for 2 hours and want to know my options. One more personnel came to us that Customer relations at that place were overwhelmed and We need to see another customer support team on Level 3 at Toronto Pearson Airport. Me and some other folks came to see Level 3 customer support team as instructed and Customer support team said to us that they are not aware why we are standing in line. Before making this announcement, we waiting in line for almost 1 hour. When it is my turn, I asked the front desk attendant what are my available options as I need to attend work tomorrow. If I get refund, I would like to make a reservation with another carrier. She yelled at me and said that they don't handle refunds and I should email or contact online. I went online where I made my initial reservation and It doesn't give me an option to cancel the flight. Instead it checked me in for another flight on the next day without my approval. In the website, it clearly says ""If you are at the airport, see a customer service personnel and they will gladly help with changes"". They made me speak with a manager and his advise was that I have only one option. My next flight was more than 12 hours. They didn't offer hotel rooms or food vouchers. Instead they suggested me to reserve a hotel room and they will refund up to $300. They said Air Canada ran out of hotel rooms in big city like Toronto but as a individual I should be able to book room on my own. I should make my own to and fro arrangements from the airport to the hotel room. I felt disappointed for purchasing a expensive ticket with them. They treat their customers like shit and has no respect. If they delay your trip, you should be fine with their decisions even if it means that you can attend your job and lose your pay.

Then, after we were home they found my husband’s basic black travel bag that was full of stuff he had already replaced. I never got my bag with irreplaceable items.

✅ Trip Verified |  Flown Air Canada from Seoul (ICN) to NYC (LGA), however, despite so many negative reviews, the service attention by the crew members were high quality and excellent. Very casual and yet professional and courteous. The business class pods were very comfortable and clean, nice sleeping pads and blankets and plush pillow and lots of movie selections. The quality of food and presentation was not impressive with not much flavor though ample enough to fill you up. Drinks were plenty. The lighting in the business cabin was relaxing. Flight was diverted to Montreal due to heavy fog in Toronto but the pilots and the crews were right on providing updates frequently which avoided passengers frustrations.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I am extremely dissatisfied with Air Canada. Besides the flight attendants themselves on the plane, the rest of the experience was awful. It began when my friend accidentally put down my nick name, ""Chase"" instead of Charles on my boarding pass. When we attempted to change, we ended up having to ""upgrade"" all 3 tickets for over $3500 and we didn't even get ""upgraded"" seats. I understand that is an error on our side, but I find it absurd that it cost everyone that much for one name change and  that we couldn't just upgrade one ticket instead of all 3. Also, the agent I spoke with on the phone was very rude, as was his supervisor. After I was told that everything was clear and I was good to go with my flight. I was woken up in the middle of the night (the morning of our flight) and told that I needed to get up and send more documents over. Next, while we were at the airport, the customer service agents at the desk were rude from checking in our bags, to the service desk in the terminal. Our flight was delayed twice (understandable), but when we approached the counter to ask about our connection that we were going to miss, we were told, ""go sit down, we have to go on our break right now"" and they two agents grabbed their stuff and walked off. We were left not knowing what was going on at the gate because the screen at the gate still read the previous flight's info the entire time we were sitting at the gate.";"""extremely dissatisfied with Air Canada""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  In August 2022 we flew from Sydney to Vancouver and our three bags didn't come with us. Two of our bags were found and sent over to Vancouver but only only one bag was then received at our hotel on day 3. AC airport baggage staff told us that only one bag was sent over but luckily we had a chip in that second bag and could see that it was at the Vancouver airport and after getting senior service staff involved we received our bag out of the lost baggage area. The third bag wasn't located whilst we were in Vancouver and was only received back in Brisbane in October. We put a claim into AC for the expenses incurred because of the delayed/lost bags and it has been two months and still nothing from them. I can understand bags going astray but it was the complete debacle around finding them and then getting them to us that amazed us. They push bags into the lost baggage area but don't take any details down so when they go looking for your bag they are looking for a black bag amongst the other hundreds of black bags.;"""complete debacle around finding bags""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience. Except for the in-flight staff. They seem to be trying to do a good job. Our trip had 4 flights from Calgary to Toronto to Windsor Ontario and back. Fog in Toronto led to a cancelled flight. Rebooked for the next day, then cancelled again and rebooked for the day of the return flight. No way to contact anyone for support. Took the train to Windsor or we would have missed the wedding we were travelling for. Then on the return trip, just a comedy of delays. Delays in the terminal, then 90+ min in the plane, while they waited for additional passengers, then they swapped out pilots, then we waited for the ground crew to return, then more new passengers, then replay all the safety info, etc etc. etc. We did finally get back to Calgary. The plane was nice, but the airline has clearly lost contact with its customers. There is no attention to the customer's experience and no regard for delivering on what they sell. Their focus is on limiting costs and increasing revenue - only. I'm just glad we managed our risk by limiting our luggage to carry-on only. I am highly reticent to travel with Air Canada, as each time I've flown with them I've had the same bad experiences of overbooked and cancelled flights. They are the worst airline I've dealt with to date.;"""No way to contact anyone for support""";"

✅ Trip Verified | I really enjoyed this flight with Air Canada. The Toronto Maple Leaf Lounge was comfortable with some excellent food on offer and I was able to find a very comfortable chair and get some work done. The flight was delayed a little but we arrived in Vancouver on-time. Overall it was a smooth ride with little turbulence. The Dreamliner is a very comfortable quiet plane and one of my favorites in the Air Canada fleet. The staff were friendly and attentive. I like the Air Canada app as I was able to pick out the films I wanted to watch and I appreciated all the choices. There are quite a few I look forward to watching on my next flight. It was great having access to wifi. Dinner and the wine were excellent. I appreciate I can review the menu on the Air Canada app before the flight. This year it has been great to be back traveling and I'll continue to be a regular customer. I look forward to my next flight.;"""staff were friendly and attentive""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  A letter I just sent to Air Canada. I think it pretty much summarizes my feelings for them at the moment. ------ Hello, I am still waiting for a status update for this case. We have been now waiting over 90 days for communication from Air Canada. We cannot check the status of our claim because we are now receiving the message ""Access to your file is no longer available. Please contact your airline for more information"". Please expedite this request. We need to talk somebody in regards to this claim. COVID is no longer an excuse for how poorly Air Canada manages customer luggage. For Air Canada, customer satisfaction now seems like an afterthought, which is why we will likely never fly with Air Canada again.  Even after suffering through this, there have been multiple instances where the customer care members will simply hang up on us, requiring us to sit through it again.

"Not Verified |  I am highly disappointed, frustrated, and traumatized by Air Canada. My flight from Cairo, Egypt to Toronto, Canada was a normal flight. We arrived to Toronto to take another flight to San Francisco. With 10+ hours of flying and only 1 hour to go to our next flight, you can imagine the exhaustion we had. We asked the workers if they can let us surpass the long line but they rudely told us to wait like everyone else. My family and I (which was 8 of us total) got in line. It was our turn to get inspected and we got through somewhat, however we had the concern that our gate was already opening. After the inspection, we had to wait just outside of it where there was a screen to wait for our names to turn green as they were x-raying our luggages to get to the US. With the last minutes of our gate closing, our concern grew and we were starting to panic because our names have not turned green yet. Not one worker helped us get to our gate and it seemed they did not care if we missed our flight. We ended up missing our flight and they told us to get to an air canada desk (which they were not specific about where this was). All of us ran through everywhere to find a desk and the workers were extremely rude and uncooperative about looking for a flight. They finally told us we had to get through the immigration customs, to get to an air canada desk to rebook our flights. We got through the immigration customs and we had to pick up our luggages. We face another issue where we could not find them. We initially thought they were on the flight we missed but fortunately they were just misplaced. We wait 30 minutes for them to give our luggages and once we get them we go to the desk. We get there and we are greeted rudely by an air canada employee where she tells one of my family members in a nasty attitude ""where does the line start?!"", implying that we should move out of the way so that other customers can be helped. We told her she was being rude and she denied it. Still, we moved out the way. An employee helped rebook our flights but we all had to get separated but at that point we did not care. They gave each one of us a hotel and meal vouchers but not to me  (which at the time i didn't check). So I had to pay for my meal which was $50. The next day we all take our flight but the last 4 of us faced the same issues as the prior situation. We fly to Montreal with no issues, but yet again we had to go through a long line to get inspected and wait in front of a screen to wait for our names to pop up. We had 2 hours for our gate to open so I thought it would be a quick wait since this should not happen for the 2nd time to us! But I was wrong. Before our flight departed, I go up to the desk and tell them why our names has not been called and they tell us they thought we each had 2 luggages but we had 1 each. That was the whole wait up and they had to make sure the system says we are in the clear but through all that we miss our flight while heading to the next long line to immigration. So, we go back and they help us rebook our flight within the next hour and hasten ourselves because we are already traumatized that we will miss our flight for the 3rd time. We get to our gate as they were calling the last of the people to get to the plane. We arrive to San Francisco with a huge relief because we are finally home! But of course, they lose our luggage. But the only good thing is that they returned them to our homes 2 days later.";"""I am highly disappointed""";"

Not Verified |  On October 20, 2022, my wife and I arrived at Raleigh Durham Airport (RDU) to take Air Canada flight 8839 to Toronto, connecting to Dubai. I was with a group of about 20. My experience there was the worst I have ever encountered while traveling. There were in fact 5 major problems I encountered trying to get tickets I had already paid for. 1. I tried to check in online the day before but their system wouldn’t let me. I then called Air Canada and was on hold for 4 hours. When someone finally answered, she told be to try again 24 hours before the second flight. That didn’t work either. 2. Since system did not allow me or many others to check in online, I showed up early, at 2:00 pm. They told us we had no tickets, we were not in the system. The same thing happened with another couple we were traveling with. After 20 minutes and several phone calls they said we had tickets. 3. Then they said we had to get an app and fill out a Covid form for Dubai. They had previously told our trip leader this wasn’t necessary, so none of us were prepared. The app worked poorly and I got locked out with the app saying I could only redo in 24 hours. Air Canada then told me they not give me a ticket. I eventually redid the app and change to my wife’s phone number. I later talked to fellow travelers in our group who took a different airline that did not require this app. 4. With a working app, I went again to the counter for my tickets. This time they told me they couldn’t scan my and my wife’s passports. No one else had this problem, and I didn’t have this problem 3 months earlier when flying on Air Canada. They had to call their office and after 40 minutes they manually got it to work. 5. I was so relieved to finally have tickets I didn’t look at where the seats were. We had previously paid $234 for seats that were next to each other. The ones we got on the two flights out were not next to each other, and the one on the flight back was next to each other but middle seats we didn’t order. Air Canada owes me $234 for not giving me the seats I paid for. I don’t want a credit because I am never flying this airline again but I'm sure that's what I'll get. During the leg to Dubai all 3 bathrooms on the of the plane left were out. Also, the movie I was watching was lost after a pilot announcement. This happened to many others too. In Raleigh, there were 3 times I was very worried I would not make it on the plane for a trip I had paid a lot of money for. This was a scarring experience and two weeks later I am still very upset.;"""worst I have ever encountered""";"

Not Verified | Our recent experience on Air Canada is the worst I have had in decades of flying. One should never book on that wretched airline. The problems arose when we were changing planes in Toronto after flying Air Canada from Europe. The flight from to Toronto was a bit late but there was still ample time for us to go through customs and all the other steps and make our connection to go home. But, Air Canada had bumped us from that flight to the same flight the next day. Even though we got to the gate for our flight home in ample time and there were seats on the plane, Air Canada refused to let us on, because, they said, our bags wouldn’t make the connection. (They easily could have made the connection had the airline tried. In fact, it seems that one of our bags did make the connection.) We said that we wanted very much to fly home then and that we’d pick up our bags the next day if they did not make the flight with us. The airline refused, including appeals to various higher ups. So, we had to waste a day at a lousy airport hotel when we needed to be home for medicine, our pet, etc. This was inexcusable. Moreover, we heard others having like awful experiences with this airline (on our flight and on others) while we were in the customer service line and at the hotel. Apparently, this airline bumps people all the time for poor reasons. To top that off, with one exception (the man at the gate to our home airport, who tried to get permission to let us on the plane), the staff was worse than useless. Every step took way longer than it should have and they had no sense of helping the much inconvenienced customers. (The woman who told us we had been bumped when we got off the plane from Rome replied, when I said we needed to get home for medicine and our pet, “the airline doesn’t care”.) Everything was extreme bureaucracy and rigidity and a lack of anything resembling competence or due process. ;"""lack of anything resembling competence""";"

Never had any issues with any other airline. Most of the people around me had the standard sized carry on baggage which just couldn’t fit in their bag sizer. It was probably their strategy to make more money. The lineups to check in my bag were crazy and the staff was horrible. They were extremely unhelpful and their kiosks were not user friendly at all.

Not Verified |  Flew with family for a vacation in Portugal leaving late June 2022, returning early July 2022. Original itinerary was round trip from Newark to Lisbon flying via Montreal on Air Canada. On day of departure our flight from Newark to Montreal was cancelled without any notice. We found out when we went to the airport. Initially Air Canada rebooked us on a flight with another airline, but when we went to check in with that airline we were told their flight was already full. Next Air Canada rebooked us to fly to Lisbon via Toronto. We arrived in Toronto but the flight from Toronto to Lisbon was delayed and then cancelled at 1:00 am. Air Canada customer service manager at Toronto announced the cancellation and said we were free to make our own hotel arrangements and that we could submit a claim for reimbursement with Air Canada. Eventually we got to Lisbon the next day. On the return journey, the flight from Lisbon to Montreal arrived close to schedule but delays in the airport meant we missed our flight from Montreal to Newark. Once again, Air Canada announced we could arrange our own hotel room for the overnight delay and submit expenses for reimbursement. Air Canada booked on a flight to Newark the next day with another airline. When we got home, we followed the process on Air Canada's website to request reimbursement and provided all required documentation (flight numbers, receipts, etc.). It took 83 days for Air Canada to respond and inform us that our claim was denied because flight delays and cancellations were due to Covid and safety issues and so did not qualify for compensation. When I responded that we submitted expenses for reimbursement based on airport announcements made by Air Canada at the airport, then came back and reiterated our claim was denied. ;"""inform us that our claim was denied""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Flying premium economy with Air Canada exposes you to both economy and premium economy service. It starts out very impressive in the sense that they did a quick beverage service with glassware and real bottles of wine followed by a meal served on porcelain tableware. My understanding is the meal is the same as economy class but it certainly is presented in a nicer way. The portion size might be a bit larger in PE. I was very impressed with how quickly the service began, it seems like we were fed within 20 minutes of the plane taking off. The only disappointment was the indignance of the male flight attendant when I asked him about the difference in the white wine selection. He just couldn’t seem to handle that. Another flight attendant heard his behaviour and came back to ask me how I liked the wine I selected. I thought that was very nice of her. When another flight attendant came to remove my tray and I held on to the wine glass, she asked me if I wanted more. I appreciated that and she even came back one more time to refill. I mention that because this distinguished PE from regular economy. The PE seat itself is very comfortable with a pitch of 38 inches. The problem is that you are exposed pretty much to the economy service for the rest of the flight. There are  no snacks in the galley except juice and pretzels and water. It is the same Air Canada pretzels they served before the pandemic. They used to have these biscotti, but they reappeared as part of the snack that was served halfway through the flight with a tuna sandwich. Two meals were served (breakfast before landing), and the breakfast is served as economy class. When meals or the mid-flight snack were not being served, the crew never circulated through the cabin to offer a glass of water. They sat in the galley and people could come and get water or pretzels or ask for juice.;"""seat itself is very comfortable""";"

"Not Verified |  We had a boarding delay of several hours in Montreal. Upon arrival at Malpensa, my checked suitcase and bicycle bag did not arrive. I waited in line at ""Lost and Found"" for an hour and a half with approximately 60 other passengers from my flight. My bags arrived 2 days later. I have tried to call and have gone online multiple times to get a refund for my extra bag charges. I has been impossible to get a real person to answer any questions. I was charged extra bag fees in Milan but was dismissed by the Italian ticket agent without getting a receipt, so I don't even know how much I was charged.

Not Verified |  We arrived in Toronto for our connecting flight to Dubai, we had to walk a long way to the next gate, after about an hour they changed our gate and another long walk, when we arrived at the new gate Air Canada advised us that our flight was delayed 2 hours, they didn’t advise their flight crew who all showed up at the original time only to find there was no airplane. We were in the last row of premium economy and after take off a baby started screaming right behind us for 2 hours, I finally had enough and requested the staff fix it.

Not Verified | On October 8th 2022, we were suppose to fly with Air Canada from Jakarta to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific then contacting flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver with Air Canada. When we went to check-in counter at Jakarta we were informed by Cathay that Air Canada has changed out flight we will have to wait more then 24 hours at Hong Kong Airport in order to fly back home and in Hong Kong they will put us in quarantine for 3 days. Cathay tried for 3 hours to contact Air Canada but they never respond there call, finally after waiting for 3 hours at Jakarta, Cathay changed our flight for next day so that we don't have to wait for 24 hour and we can still fly out of Hong Kong with our original flight Air Canada on 9th October. The next day again we went back to Jakarta Airport to fly with Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong then with contacting flight with Air Canada again we found out that Air Canada has cancelled our reservation. We ended up to buy another 2 tickets from Jakarta to Vancouver for $1400 dollars. Never again fly with Air Canada incompetent airline which is the worst.;"""Never again fly with Air Canada""";"

"Not Verified |  The flight from Denver to Toronto was fine, apr. 3 hrs. The A220 was surprisingly comfortable and we liked the large windows. Service was mediocre as we were just served a packaged roll and I chose coffee. After that we were completely ignored for 2.5 hours but it is only a medium length flight. The second flight was very poor. A Boeing 787-9 in premium economy. There was nothing ""premium"" about it! I was in the first seat in the premium economy section and was constantly getting bumped in the head by rude passengers with backpacks, turning and slamming me. The seats were very uncomfortable and there weren't even minimal footrests. The leg room was no greater than on the previous A320 economy. We were served lunch. It was O.K. and consisted of a lamb shank and mashed potatoes. Also a mini rather dry salad and a very mini piece of dry cake. No after lunch beverages were offered for 8 hours. The flight attendants went into hibernation. They came out of hiding about an hour before we landed and served us breakfast. It consisted of a yogurt and an inedible packaged chocolate filled roll. I practically had to trip a flight attendant to get a second cup of coffee. And that is Premium Economy on an Air Canada long distance flight!

✅ Trip Verified |  Disgraceful airline and an absolute shame to Canadian standards. I had a simple 1.5 hour direct journey from Boston to Toronto. This unfolded into a nightmare that lasted about 12 hours. Two of my flights from Boston to Toronto in the morning were cancelled, thus missed my connection at noon with another airline! Rebooked flight was from Boston to Montreal to Toronto of which both flights were delayed by over 1.5 hours.

✅ Trip Verified |  Will never fly Air Canada again.  Checked in 4pm at Victoria BC for first leg of trip to Vancouver. Could not get seat allocation for my wife and I for Vancouver - Sydney second leg. Told to get that in Vancouver. Had to wait at check in for 3 hours until someone turned up at check in desk 35 mins before scheduled departure to obtain seat allocation. And we booked the airfare some 6 weeks earlier. We were allocated middle seats in separate aisles, so in 30 years of international flying, we could not be seated together for a 14 hour flight, nor allocated a desired aisle seat for myself. Even then, I finished up swapping seats so another couple could be seated together. ;"""Will never fly Air Canada again""";"

✅ Trip Verified | We flew Air Canada from Cairo, Egypt on a 787 Dreamliner to Montreal. Business class. Nice flight terrible food. We got to Montreal late but our connecting flight was also delayed. No flight crew. We were finally boarded for the short flight to Chicago. We waited on the plane for another hour. Air Canada cancelled the flight due to mechanical issues. We then had to wait hours in line to get hotel taxi and food arrangements. It was after midnight before we got to our hotel then up again at 4.30 am to get back to the airport to catch the flight to Chicago then another flight to St Louis. I was told I would be reimbursed for a Chicago hotel room I had already booked and paid for and was too late to cancel. Well today I was informed no reimbursement because unscheduled mechanical issues.

"Not Verified | Montreal to San Jose via Toronto. The Airline lost my backpack on the connection in Toronto. I filled the form out and hoped to get my luggage back soon. The next morning I receive an email with a reference-number. With that and my last name I should be able to check the status of my lost luggage. Long story short, the wrote my name wrong in the computer so I wasn't able to log in. After I fixed this I was shocked. My address, were they can deliver the backpack was not in there.

✅ Trip Verified | Air Canada is simply a disaster. We had a wonderful trip in Europe with my family, but the flights were a nightmare. They lost are luggage for 3 weeks, I came back home before my bags, they took my baby stroller and sent it straight to Seattle having a stop in Montreal for 3 hrs. There are never employees at the counter, they always tell you to call customer service that takes 1hr or so to get a representative, also they are not able to transfer you at the phone, so be careful when you pick an option in the main menu, and etc.., I can keep telling many stories that we had with them. Please do not fly with them, at least abroad.;"""Air Canada is simply a disaster""";"

Not Verified | I had only been to Canada once before to Montreal by bus- when I was young and poor - that was a considerably better experience than Air Canada- that is disorganized filled with ambiguous phrase or non-articulated conditions on charging and delays and shamelessly indifferent to customer comfort. I think the Canadian government should look into this company. From a distance I have always had the absolute greatest respect for Canadian culture — this airline is a liability - it has utterly changed my sense of this nation and culture I will certainly never again fly Air Canada - will never come to Toronto again - and will as widely as I can - disperse the information of Air Canada's unrestrained jerking around of its customers — my flight itinerary has been as simple as can be — Toronto NYC - a simple hour and some minutes flight on a Sunday — my flight at 6 am was cancelled - I was on the phone for three hours, three hours wrangling with customer service who seemed to have no authority on what they were doing who were claiming I had to pay to be placed on another flight pay extra in addition to my flight - even though Air Canada had cancelled! What kind of a scam is that? Complete incentive for the airline to cancel on people left and right — Later in the airport an agent informed me that my basic ticket purchase has no “protection” against airline cancellations — completely unregulated unprincipled gouging — I was placed on a flight with a 2:30 departure - that again was cancelled - no COVID congestions no serious weather advisories in Toronto —it is a sunny day —yes the weather is not good in New York but the airport delays are by 15 minutes nothing more serious — over a simple hour flight I have been delayed by 14 hours with the prospect earlier had I not vehemently defended myself of paying for this privilege — REPUGNANT -;Air Canada customer review;"

Not Verified |  Flight from LA to Toronto went fine. The problems started when we landed in Toronto. We had a 5-hour layover and were trying to catch an earlier flight. Made it through customs in minutes, looking good to catch the earlier flight. That’s when things went horribly awry. After customs, you get dumped out into the main departures section of the terminal - outside security. Then, after waiting in security line, they test every piece of carry-on luggage. Smallest test rack I have ever seen. I have an internationally sized roller bag and have never had an issue with carry on in any country. In fact, the luggage fit fine on the Air Canada overhead on the first leg of the flight — not in Toronto! Giving up on the earlier fight, we accepted we would need to bag check and head back in through security. At least we could get food or go to an airport lounge. Wrong. Even though Air Canada flew us from LA to Toronto, they treated the second leg of the flight like we just walked in off the street. No checking bags until 4 hours before flight is scheduled to depart. So now we have to wait outside near the main ticket counters for over an hour until we can check our bags. If we had checked our bags in LA, they would have had them off our first plane almost 6 hours before the next flight departed, so they can definitely do it, they just refuse to. So Air Canada changes the carry on rules mid-trip, spits us outside security and won’t do anything to resolve the issue, on a flight and connection they booked. This will be my one and only flight on Air Canada. I strongly discourage others from using them. Their overbearing rules and inconsistent standards can leave you hanging and they just don’t care. Complete clown show.;"""This will be my one and only flight on Air Canada""";"

It was delayed due to technical issue but her connecting flight was still missed because of this, they refused to hold the plane for 10 minutes that it would have taken her to make it. So we missed the flight home and the only other available one was 8 hours later. Several other people were at the customer service desk complaining about missing their flights because of the issue and the staff was very rude to every one of them, despite it being Air Canada’s fault that they’re all late.;"""Terrible customer service""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  After my travel agent booked my flight, I found out, on the ticket, that I had to pay an extra $75 per suitcase. On my way to Manchester, the plane was late. I was told that the preferred seating (leg room) which I had paid $162 for, one way, was no longer available. After several attempts, the person in charge finally got me a legroom seat after all. On my way back from Manchester to Toronto I got to the airport at about 8;30 am for a 12;30 pm take off and was told the flight was cancelled. We were put up for the night, meals included, in a mediocre hotel. Food was also mediocre. After boarding the plane next day I was told once again that the leg room seat I had paid $149 for was not available. As the plane was not full, the stewardess noted a legroom seat that was unoccupied and said, ""you'd better grab that one, but if someone else claims it, you'll have to move."" I paid a total of $311 extra, on top of my flight for legroom seating and was eventually granted these seats as if it was a favour. Another steward told me to put my mask on as I was taking it off to eat. They were bringing the meals at the time. I ignored her so I could eat. After that she ignored me, not once, but twice, when the drinks trolley was brought along. I had to go after her to request an orange juice. The second time, I had to ask a different stewardess for a cup of tea because madam seemed determined not to serve me, and once again cruised past me, refusing to make eye contact, while I called out to her. Her behaviour was appalling. No one can eat with a mask on, and food and drink service was included in the price of my ticket. Overall, my first experience with Air Canada was not good. And I thought Air Transat was bad.";"""experience with Air Canada was not good""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Without question this is the worst long haul flight I have ever taken. I couldn’t believe that for 11 hours we were confined to the limited legroom of a 737. Was the 737 designed for long haul? The first leg of the overnight flight, from Vancouver to Halifax, didn’t serve a meal, but put out the lights and expected us to sleep. During the night we were hungry and thirsty, and had to go to the galley and ask for refreshments. Thank goodness we managed to buy a decent breakfast at Halifax Airport! Then back onto another 737 for the second leg of the flight. The meal offered was small and fairly tasteless (I think the worst I have ever experienced on long haul), and again the need to visit the galley to stay hydrated. The overhead lockers were absolutely jam packed by the time we got seated, and I ended up putting my rucksack under the seat, eating into my already limited legroom. It’s almost impossible to compare Air Canada with other carriers which I use for long haul e.g. BA, Thai, Malaysian, Cathay, Emirates, where the passenger is kept fed and hydrated by attentive staff. When I arrived at Heathrow I took two flights to reach home in northern Scotland- with BA and Loganair. Each flight was less than an hour and had I more room and comfort than crossing the Atlantic!;"""confined to the limited legroom of a 737""";"

Then they canceled my wife's return ticket without notice, and I was forced to buy a brand new ticket to get home in time! So wonderful, truly a memorable flight experience. They offered me a “discounted” direct flight home for only double the cost of my original round trip ticket, what an amazing deal. When I showed them the same flight on their website for half that price they were completely confused. Ended up purchasing that ticket, because it was cheaper than the “solution” they were offering for the problem they created. 0/10. Zero stars.

Not Verified |  Flew from Toronto to San Francisco, Air Canada was making all passengers place their roller bag and personal items in the baggage sizing tray to make sure they were up to par before letting them proceed to security line, created a long unnecessary line just to size bags and many people were told their personal items were oversized despite clearly being small enough to fit under the seat, and were made to go back to the check-in desk agent to pay 30$ per bag to check in a small personal item (and go through another line, no less). No other airline was doing this except for Air Canada. I travel frequently, approximately every 6 weeks and travel carry-on only, my backpack was also refused despite having taken this backpack on Air Canada and other airlines multiple times before and fitting perfectly well under the seat as my personal item, and when I brought this up to the agent they said 'that was before, we're auditing people now'. Despite being 3 hours early to the airport, we still only made it to our gate 15 mins before boarding because of this unnecessary hassle. The AC agents were so rude, creating unnecessary delays.

✅ Trip Verified | A completely full flight. Departed and arrived more or less on time. Seats in economy are of the type that slide forward when you recline, which limits reclining ability for anyone over 6 feet tall. In practical terms it means leg room is reduced cf. advertised. It was bearable though. Main issue was with the food and beverage service. Food portions were stingy. Two tiny drinks in 9 hours is simply not enough to stay hydrated.

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Dubai-Toronto (4 hour layover) and Toronto-Montreal on June 15th/16th 2022. Two things happened on this trip, first, the Boeing 787-9 (long haul flight) upkeep and comfort was in dark contrast to the Airbus A220-300 used for the 1 hour flight. Yes, the Airbus A220-300 was a much more comfortable flight in everyway. Second, I arrived in Montreal after a very very long journey and had to wait in the understaffed luggage claims line, for another hour, with 30 or so other passengers from exclusively AC flights, all of us with missing luggage, confused and tired. During this wait, we witnessed the comedy act of airport security walling off the luggage carrousel which was overpiling with late / delayed lost baggage. No information was shared other than, we will let you know, enjoy your stay in Canada. After 2 weeks of calling, filing in useless complaints reports on AC's website and making trips to the airport, I was finally re-united with one bag, which was in a 3rd party storage facility a 15 mins drive from the airport, the 2nd bag was delivered the following day. Compensation? fill in another report and attach your receipts (what justification can you give a passenger for delaying their baggage for 2 weeks, I flew to your hub in Toronto for God's sake, the layover was 4 hours how did you misplace the luggage?). During this time all the communication and effort was one way, this is a disgusting level of due diligence from an airline which promotes itself as excellence. This is not excellence, this is utter garbage. On my return flight I flew premium economy, little did I know, I would experience the novelty of skipping a hot meal on a flight for the 1st time in my life, the food was inedible. In September (3 months after my flight) an AC customer service agent emails me stating ''we have decided to compensate you for your 14 day delayed baggage, we are happy to give $400 CAN. $400 CAN for losing my luggage for 2 weeks. On top of that, the customer service agent instructs me to share all, and I mean ALL, of my banking info. so that they could transfer this meagre payoff. Why? They do not have a system which allows transfer's to customer's living abroad.  its 2022, I used a credit card to pay for the flight, all details of which are logged and registered on your system, at least, a normally functioning company's system. I have now spent 2 weeks advising AC that it is unacceptable to make such a statement (international transfers) and unacceptable to ask your passengers to share their bank details online via email. Air Canada as an airline is a total disgrace to Canada.;"""disgusting level of due diligence""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  First flight on AC on the route from Frankfurt to Toronto. Overall, it was a solid experience with some light and lots of shadow. The flight was operated by a Boeing 777-200LR with a 3-4-3 seat formation, which is standard today for this type of aircraft, but meant that seats were rather on the narrow side. The legroom was relatively tight. In particular, it bothered me that the life west of the seat in front of me blocked a lot of the room under the seat so that it was difficult to stretch my legs, something I have not experienced on the same type of aircraft with other airlines. However, the recline was fine for a standard economy seat. I did not find the food tasty, and the portions were also rather on the small side. But the service was overall friendly and attentive. There was a bar for (non-alcoholic) drinks during the flight and the cabin attendants occasionally passed through the cabin to offer water. The worst part of the experience was the deplaning: We arrived at the gate half an hour late. It was announced that only connecting passengers should leave the aircraft (regardless of whether they had a tight connection), while everyone else had to stay on board (of course, this was not enforced for Business class passengers). When all the connecting passengers (or those who claimed to be) had left, we had to wait for five minutes (why?), before everyone else could deplane. Overall the process was chaotic and inefficient. It took 20 minutes from arriving at the gate, until I could leave the aircraft even though I was seated at the front of the cabin. Overall, it was by far not my favourite way to cross the Atlantic. Yet, I would probably not mind to fly AC again if the schedule works and the price is right.;"""not my favourite way to cross the Atlantic""";"

The food was probably the worst food i was presented in my life of flying. Poor quality, cold and not edible. I was shocked that on the return 10 hour flight we were given hot poor quality dinner (with solid hard cold bun and butter and tasteless brownie,) soon after take off and then one hour before landing a cold croissant with fruit yogurt (only edible food during the flight). It would have been better and more respectful to their customers, if they did not serve anything and asked people to get their own food on board. 10 hours flight and we got off starving as none of my food was edible. ;"""none of my food was edible""";"

Decent selection of food. It is here that AC has improved its game and uses outside chefs to provide menu items. Still, some minor services which they used to provide were not available.

"Not Verified |  I normally go to USA every year. This time my agent bought me and wife return tickets to fly from Brisbane to Minneapolis. Normally I used two flights to travel from Brisbane to Minneapolis. But it appeared that this trip had three flights via Canada. All the flights were delayed and we miss the one from Montreal to Minneapolis and had to spend time at the airport over night. The return trip back to Australia was worse; again all flights were delayed over 4 hours and we miss the one from Vancouver to Brisbane. They put us up in a hotel in Vancouver and promised to pay all expenses. But when receipts for expenses were submitted they refused saying that it was due to computer glitches. Moreover, we were put on two flights from Vancouver; one from vancouver Sydney and the other from Sydney to Brisbane which means we had 4 flights from Minneapolis to Brisbane. Each trip took 2 days instead of 1 day. When landed at Brisbane one of luggage was missing and it took 2 days to get it back. Never fly Air Canada.";"""All the flights were delayed""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The flight and check-in process went well. The information provided in the app was useful, though the seat map displaying which seats are occupied differed between the Air Canada website and the app. During boarding, ground staff grouped zones 4 and 5 together after boarding zone 3, which confused several passengers, including me. There was also a long line in the jet bridge. The cabin was clean and service was friendly and efficient. There was a rude passenger whom the stewardesses dealt with professionally. A stewardess also confirmed a special meal I had requested and was respectful regarding the handling and opening of the meal package. The IFE system in the seat next to mine was broken, which is odd, even for an older 787. Overall, the flight was up to my expectations for an Air Canada economy class flight and was generally average.;"""service was friendly and efficient""";"

"Not Verified |  I was expecting the worst when I stepped aboard this 787-8 at EDI. I was the first passenger aboard and there was no one to greet me. After an initial rush of excitement that there was no crew and we would have free run of the aircraft cabin crew dashed up the aisle to greet us, looking slightly surprised that boarding had started without their knowledge. We were shown to our seats, stowed our hand baggage in the 787's massive overhead bins, and settled down. Cabin crew came by to introduce themselves and take our food and beverage orders. There were no pre-departure drinks nor hot towels. I looked at the amenity kit; socks and an eyeshade, unbranded, in a black plastic pouch. I grimaced. We taxied out to the westbound runway and were underway about an hour after scheduled departure time. Drinks service commenced swiftly after takeoff and I was soon enjoying Laurent Perrier brut and a packet of cashews. My eighteen-month old son had fallen asleep in my arms during the take-off run - as one does - and was now sleeping soundly. The purser came and suggested I make use of the empty 1D as a bed for him. Seated in 2A I could just about see his feet if I poked my head over the aisle - the privacy on this configuration of seating is very good. Lunch was served as we climbed out over the Western Isles and was very good. Drinks service was decent throughout the first two hours of the flight and nothing felt rushed, or too much trouble. My woke at about the two hour point and was hungry. The cabin crew swiftly prepared a meal for him and none of it felt like too much trouble at all. After about three hours it was time for bed, with the cabin crew locking the window dimmers and turning off the lights. The fact that it was early afternoon local time and mid morning at destination didn't seem a factor. most of the business class cabin obeyed the crew's wishes and went to sleep. I turned to the entertainment system. While the choice of movies is pretty decent, the decision to include two episodes, mid season, from TV shows is baffling. As is the inclusion of three-hour long music programmes, which must be listened to in entirety with no option to skip to the song you want. Why whole albums can't just be uploaded giving the user the ability to navigate to the music they want to listen to, like almost all airlines do these days, is truly baffling. The entertainment system doesn't feel cheap at all, but this particular part of it felt like it had been beamed in from some tragic charter flight from 1990. After a couple of hours had elapsed the intermission was over and it was time to wake up again. Normal service resumed and we were served a snack of charcuterie, cheeses, bread, and pickles. Soon it was time for landing and we found ourselves back on the ground in Toronto. The cabin crew answered that ""metered deplaning"" was in effect and 50 passengers would be allowed off every five minutes, with connecting passengers taking priority. Although we couldn't provide evidence of having a connection as we hadn't been able to check in online for our onward United flight, the purser let us off anyway. This is clearly a paired back service, with Covid as the excuse. Despite this, the crew made us feel welcome, went the extra mile, and probably broke the rules, all for our comfort.";"""the crew made us feel welcome""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The price was affordable but the service was lousy. When I arrived at my final destination I realized that they lost my checked-in baggage for which I paid 250 euros! . At the counter they told me that they would solve my problem in 3 days and I have been waiting almost 1 month for information about my luggage, unbelievable. The customer service is really bad, I had to wait up to 1 hour every day I called to be attended! The other thing I wanted to emphasize was the punctuality of this airline. Unfortunately, I had to fly back with this airline and to make matters worse I missed my last flight connection from Brussels to Hamburg because the plane landed 1 hour late in Brussels. The boarding gate was slammed in my face ... I waited 6 hours, after Air Canada rebooked my flight with Lufthansa, which means that I waited around 6 hours more in order to arrive to my final destination. Please avoid traveling with this irresponsible airline.;"""customer service is really bad""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with Air Canada from Vancouver to London Heathrow today (17/09/2022) and I have a 10 hour layover so I thought I would post a return review but it doesn’t get any better than my outbound flight. The Crew were pleasant enough upon boarding and they were more present in the Cabin on the return flight but that’s about it. The menu choices were the same and not appealing. A hot meal was provided but the Continental Breakfast did make everyone laugh. A croissant & a Yogurt. A crew member was later shouting at a passenger when starting approach into London as the passenger had put their backpack behind their feet instead of the overhead lockers and they were sat next to an emergency exit. This woman shouted from the other side of the aircraft “Your bag can’t go there”, “it wasn’t there on takeoff was it so it can’t be on landing”, “it’s an emergency exit”. This crew member should’ve approached this individual on a 1-1 basis and speak to them. I had a Cold on this flight so I needed to change my masks frequently. The first time, I went to use the Bathroom to blow my nose and as my mask was soiled, I binned it and walked towards the back of the aircraft with a piece of clothing covering my mouth & nose and a staff member acted as if I had the plague. The second time I had to do the same and change my mask, I stood at the back of the aircraft whilst the crew were talking once again and I was ignored.;"""Crew were pleasant enough upon boarding""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I don’t know what to expect from Air Canada as it was the first time flying to Canada and with Air Canada. I would guess that the crew did not want to be there but this was clear as day. The crew were pleasant enough upon welcoming but no where the standards that I am used to nor that I was expect from a long-haul airline. The Crew were quite rude when they were present in the Cabin. Crew were in the back of the aircraft chatting amongst themselves with the Curtains drawn. This was a day flight that took off a little later than scheduled, after 14:00 which added more to the confusion. Passengers were searching for Crew for Drinks and went to the back of the aircraft where they still stood talking and were asked when there would be another service. They answered “Help yourself and take some Pretzels whilst you’re there”. I was astounded at service or lack of, and expected way better. I would avoid this airline at all costs unless this couldn’t be helped!;"""I would avoid this airline""";"

Great smooth flight with very attentive FA’s. We had the middle 2 seats and the only thing we didn’t like was the fact the divider didn’t go down so we couldn’t communicate very well.

Not Verified |  I've been a long time user of Air Canada flight passes and up until now they have worked well for me and my family. I don't know what has changed with Air Canada but be aware they are not what they use to be. I booked my Wife with her flight pass and selected her seat. At this time the plane was just over half full. Immediately after booking her seat I tried to book my own seat with my flight passes. I got an online response back saying the plane was sold out even though I could plainly see there was over 40 seats left unsold. I called customer service only to be told my flight pass was an M class ticket and there were no M class seats available. The only reason I purchase flight passes in the first place was to be able to book my flights in the busy season knowing I could always get a seat. 80% of the time the regular economy fare is much cheaper than the cost of a single flight pass. Once again Air Canada you have taken the lead as one of the worlds worst airline for service communication and performance. The last couple of years I really thought you were getting your act together in these very tough times. But now it looks like you are falling back to your monopolistic, don't give a damn take it or leave it ways.;"""worst airline for service communication""";"

No drinks even water offered through the night. Family with two year old twins behind me, never witnessed any help or a reassuring word offered to them. The staff didn’t really have a pleasant word for anyone. Went to the toilet in the night and it was awful, smelt and the seat was very dirty, needed checking a little more often.

We saw people from our flight board the connecting flight with no problem. Only on presenting our Boarding Pass did we find out we could not board.

✅ Trip Verified |  After waiting at the gate for one hour as the plane had arrived late and had to be inspected, we finally boarded at 10pm. Once inside the plane, we were informed we had to wait due to an electrical storm. An hour later around 11pm, the plane attempted to move but had a technical issue. The staff attempted to fix it for hours but were unable to. We were informed at 2am that our flight was cancelled and we had to exit the plane and retrieve our luggages. We were also informed that there was no hotel available. As we exited the plane, we waited an extra 30 minutes to be able to reach baggage claim and leave the airport. We received zero  compensation: I had to pay for my taxi there and back the next day, accommodation and food. The plane was reschedule for the next day at 5pm (not ideal in my opinion, I asked to change but they refused). The plane was delayed because it arrived late from a prior trip: this is not an issue out of their control. The plane was delayed an extra hour due to a problem out of their control. The day-long delay was their fault: technical issue is their fault. Air Canada does not care about its customers (safety or otherwise - honestly 1 hour to check a plane in between two flights? No.). I asked to be reimbursed for the expenses, they refused. I asked to be compensated for the 1 day delay, they refused. I tried again using Air Cover, they refused.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly Air Canada again. My family and I had a 10 a.m. morning flight scheduled to depart Dublin with a 5.5 hour layover in Toronto in order to make it stress-free back to Florida. For unknown reasons (not weather-related) Air Canada delayed our Dublin flight so it did not leave Dublin until about 1530 (3:30 p.m.). They did not offer any sort of compensation for meals while we were stranded in the airport waiting for information about the flight, they kept pushing back the departure time in small 1-2 hour increments. When we finally arrived in Toronto, we had to run through the airport to another section, then had multiple stops for Immigration and Customs. Air Canada did not offer assistance getting through the airport nor offer any assurance that we would make our flight home. We had no time to get a bite to eat or rest because the 5.5 hour layover I planned did not happen. The only reason we made our flight from Toronto to Orlando, was because Customs searched the plane for 60 minutes looking for drugs, according to the Air Canada Rouge pilot, since the plane just came from Montego Bay. We were the last people to board the plane, breathless of course from running through the airport. I was stressed, my children were stressed and it was a horrible day. I requested compensation for the 5-hour delayed flight from Dublin to Toronto but because it was an ""in-transit"" flight, I am not eligible for compensation - no matter that I was inconvenienced tremendously.

I asked this matter to the ground crew when he hand me the boarding pass and he said its already in the system.

Not Verified |  I was disappointed by Air Canada. They don’t provide headphones (although they will sell you a set).  It was a 4.5 hour flight, but they don’t provide even the smallest snack. Worst of all, they charge $35 to check a bag in. So people don’t do that if they can take a large carry-on for the overhead locker plus a smaller one for under the seat. Consequently, on my flight they ran out of room in the overhead lockers, so had to start offering to check some bags in to the hold for free. What a ridiculous system. Most airlines encourage as much luggage as possible to be checked in which reduces the chaos in the narrow aisle when embarking and disembarking.  They encourage cabin luggage but don’t have enough capacity to handle it when the customers do exactly what the airline encouraged them to do. And they give their passengers jet lag by having the blinds down on a daytime flight - flying eastward in daylight you have to stay awake. Chatting to one of the staff he said it made it easier for the staff if the passengers sleep. ;"""disappointed by Air Canada""";"

Not Verified | Toronto to Manchester. Appalling customer service, before flight and during. They clearly treat their customers with disdain if not contempt. During the flights Manchester to Toronto (and return), the cabin staff did the bare minimum. An elderly woman had to ask three times for a glass of water. The food offerings were just about edible. No water service at all, during a long haul flight. Absolutely the worst cabin service I've ever experienced, and that includes the dire Ryanair. The flights were delayed. Indeed, all the Air Canada flights from Toronto that day were delayed. I had booked my ticket on 18th October 2021 and checked in for the flight online as soon as I was able, but I was not allocated a seat but placed on standby. Yet Air Canada was still selling economy seats on the flight after I had checked in. At the airport we were informed that the flight had been overbooked. Absolutely appalling practice. Will never fly Air Canada again and would strongly recommend others to avoid like the plague.;"""Appalling customer service""";"

Air Canada is just another addition to a long list of airlines who don't really care about their customers. They just are collecting dollars hoping for the people who won't chase down the refunds.

✅ Trip Verified |  This was our first trip post Covid to Germany and as it was high season, we wanted to be comfortable so we booked J-Class for our trip to and from FRA via YYZ from YOW. Our check in at YOW was seamless as well as being very professional. The Maple Leaf Lounge was well staffed, spotlessly cleaned with very fresh tasty food and drink to enjoy. Boarding was very easy via Zone-1 and we were able to get our carry on into the overhead lockers (Full flight as well) on the new Airbus-220 in which we found clean and well appointed. Service as expected on a short inter city flight was well done by very polite professional crew. On an arrival in YYZ we transited to the Air Canada Signature Lounge where we enjoyed a small hot meal with appetizer with appropriate wine and champagne. Boarding in YYZ for FRA was seamless using Zone-1 and flight left late due to the number of passengers (full flight). On board service, food and drink selection was excellent due to the type of overseas flight. On arrival in FRA, we start at the B-Concourse with a 20-minute walk through immigration to the baggage hall where our baggage (4 pieces) was coming off the belt. On our return we changed a later flight to an earlier domestic connection easily thanks to the FRA staff. The MLL in FRA was excellent well appointed with food, drink with helpful staff. Even took advantage of having a shower before departure which was very nice. The FRA YYZ flight was exceptional service as well great food and drink. Even the Captain entered the first J Cabin to talk to passengers which was a nice touch. On arrival in YYZ no issues with customs or immigration with thanks to the Arrive Canada Ap and NEXUS. Our last flight was delayed due to a weather issue from the aircraft leaving DEN for YYZ. The CCSA kept everyone informed on delays as well as my email and Ap messaging service. On arrival in YOW our baggage arrived so no issues with this flight. In conclusion Air Canada handled itself brilliantly and the number of emails as well as text messages were very reassuring that they were doing their best to keep us informed at all times.;"""Air Canada handled itself brilliantly""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  On 17 Jul 22, my family and I traveled under Air Canada (AC) booking # 4GN88Y to catch a flight (flight # AC8927) from Toronto (TOR) to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) leaving Toronto-Pearson IAP at 2030 hrs. We had arrived earlier in the day around 1630 to TOR on AC flight AC897 from Athens, Greece; an exhausting/grueling 10-hour flight. We had about a four-hour layover between flights. Around 2025 hrs, just before our scheduled boarding time, an AC rep, announced over the PA system there could be a delay of about a 1/2 hour - hour, as a co-pilot had not arrived for our flight. Surprisingly, around 2045 hrs, the AC rep announced we all would board the plane for PIT. All PIT passengers boarded the flight for PIT, after about 15 - 20 mins we were informed by the pilot that the co-pilot hadn't arrived, the flight was canceled, and we had to deplane & go back in the terminal and see AC personnel on the 3rd floor for assistance in rebooking our flight. My family/all of the PIT-bound passengers deplaned & went inside, where an AC rep let us know we would have to go through Customs (Again!), and try to get rebooked on another PIT flight. This would be the last information an in-person AC rep gave us at TOR IAP, and things became very disorganized. We made it through customs and went to retrieve our bags; no AC rep was there to give guidance/assistance (took over an hour!). The AC area was a catastrophe complete with crying children & stressed-out adults who didn't know what to do. When we finally got my daughter’s luggage it was badly damaged (caster wheel missing/hard case cracked); the luggage was only a few yrs old, and cost around $100. We discussed renting a car (one-way to PIT) and driving home that night, as my wife and I had work the next day, and my daughter had a law school prep class. We were exhausted & just needed to get home. While my wife & daughter, who were exhausted & frustrated waited for our baggage, I went to the 3rd floor & tried to find an in-person AC rep, but to no avail, all AC personnel appeared to be gone for the day. An airport employee directed me to a bank of phones to contact AC for rebooking & to get a voucher for a hotel if we had to stay overnight. I called from the bank of phone; got disconnected! However, a fellow passenger was able to get in touch with an AC (""Brian"", I believe), who advised he could book my family on a AC Flight from TOR to PIT the next afternoon around 1415 hrs. He also advised he couldn't help with securing a hotel, but if we could manage to get a hotel room, we could submit the expenses to AC for ""prompt"" reimbursement. I asked Brian about getting reimbursed by AC for renting a car and driving home (one-way rental to PIT); he informed AC would definitely reimburse us for this expense, as well as fuel costs for the vehicle, if we submitted receipts to the AC website. Based upon the affirmative representation from an AC rep that we would be reimbursed for renting a vehicle (& fuel for vehicle) we made the decision to rent a car, which took over an hour and cost $300; we also incurred fuel and toll charges. Arrived home about 0545 hrs, totally stressed out and sick to our stomachs. Filed a claim with AC & after now about 45 days, all we have received is an auto reply email AC rec'd our claim. No reimbursement, no phone call from AC with an update, & certainly no apology from AC! All we ask is that someone from AC have the decency to help resolve this long-overdue claim.";"""help resolve this long-overdue claim""";"

Not Verified |  Orlando to Halifax via Montreal. We used another airline to fly from Florida to Halifax. But our Air Canada experience from Halifax, to Montreal, and then to Orlando, was handled really well. As we all know, many airlines are understaffed, flights are cancelled and flyers are left waiting at gates for hours while crew from another flight arrives. It's routine, every time I have flown in the last year. Our departing flight from Halifax was a half hour late. We received a prompt email and were reassured our connection in Montreal would be held for us and 16 other passengers. The counter check in was smooth. The clerk was polite and friendly. She told us the connecting flight would be held to accommodate us and the other passengers. When we arrived at the gate, announcements were made to reassure us that our trip would not be cancelled or further delayed. We boarded the flight when they said we would. Our arrival in Montreal was also guided. The clerks moved us to Priority security check-in, and then to a counter for entrance to Customs. So apparently, US nationals are put through customs in Montreal before we fly back to our country. That went smooth too. In addition to us, there were about 30 other passengers expedited through this staging area and onto Customs counters. A man directed all of us to the counters and assured us our flights were waiting for us. He was emotionally poised and seemed to know exactly what was going on with the flights. The customs counter woman was also polite. I am impressed with our experience with Air Canada and I will fly them again.;"""impressed with our experience""";"

We missed our transfer due to this, but when we asked to be rebooked and provided a hotel (due to a 23 hour layover) we were told ‘I don’t know why the pilot told you that’ and the customer service agent insisted the delay was due to the weather (despite the fact that we had already landed before the delay). No hotel was provided and the airline proceeded to not load up ur bags on our new flight meaning we arrived home with lost baggage. Please do not fly with this airline, the price and customer service is awful, I would rather fly Ryanair.;"""Never flying with this airline again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly Air Canada again. They delayed my flight over an hour and instead of holding the connecting flight for 10 minutes for the many people on the late flight they have us a 6 hour lay over. I saw they had a large standby list for that flight so I get the feeling they delayed it specifically to accommodate them while still taking my money. Horrible customer service, flight attendants were rude, and zero compensation for the costs I will incur having to stay in a different city.;"""Horrible customer service""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  This my first and last time ever flying Air Canada. I had a horrible experience. My plane was scheduled to leave PDX Airport at 6:30 am on 8/25 I arrived in more than enough to to board the flight the Staff announced that the plane would be late because ""there were too many planes in the air.""  We were told that the plane would be leaving PDX Airport 45 minutes late. I was scheduled to land in Vancouver BC to connect with my flight to Puerta Vallarta to leave at 8:50 am. When I inquired if we arrived late how would that affect my flight out of Canada the flight attendant informed me that I would have 26 minutes to get to my next gate she reported it was narrow but I would make it on time. We landed in Canada we were quickly notified that there were no steps available to leave the plane and that their would be a 15 - 20 minute wait because they needed to find steps so we could deboard the plan. We waited on the tarmac for 30 minutes once the steps arrived folks was fussing, cussing, and angry that multiple patrons including me the missed their connecting flights the staff did not care they offered no support or assistance I had to walk around talking to several air Canada flight Staff members no one had answers they all acted as if they had no clue about their jobs. I asked to speak with a manager this was no help at all he was rude as well when I asked if they could assist me with finding a flight he told me there was nothing he could do. They also lost my luggage it took them hours to find it when they finally did I got no apologies. I arrived at 7ish in the morning had to sit in the airport over 15 hrs while in Canada until 11:35 pm to catch a new flight to Puerta Vallarta that will have me arrive at 8/26 at 10:11 am.";"""I had a horrible experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Arrived early for boarding, once we got to the front of the line, they told us we needed to check our bags in because they ran out of space in the overhead compartments. I really don't understand how you can run out of space, when you arrange for an aircraft for a certain number of people. The Air Canada rep was very cold and careless about the situation. It's one thing to have changes, but at least be friendly and show some respect to your customers. She brushed off any questions that I was about to ask, and rushed me through. Couldn't get two words in. When we boarded the plane, the seats were very dirty - crumbs, tissues, and garbage in the area of the seatbelt and around the chair. This made us feel unsafe, considering we are still in a pandemic. You say you are taking every possible precaution to maintain the cleanliness for the safety of the passengers, but clearly we are not seeing that. The menus and the safety feature pamphlet were also filthy and sticky. Very minor issue - no free snacks? come on. Another minor issue - the outlets for the headphones are for those that don't even sell anymore. Like what? After we landed, we waited almost 45 minutes to exit the plane, because they were not able to dock it in the right spot. Something was blocking? It really was not made clear to the passengers as to what was happening. It would have taken you 30 seconds or less to explain to the passengers, instead of leaving them hanging. Exit the airplane, to find out our checked luggage had not been loaded. Waited another 40-45 minutes for them to load it and collect our baggage. I will never fly with this airline again. Horrible representation of what Canada is all about. I have flown with cheaper airlines and received more compassion and respect, and overall customer service. Unacceptable.;"""I will never fly with this airline again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Air Canada is really struggling lately. They used to be my go-to despite often having some delays on their routes, but nowadays it's just completely spiraled into nonsense. Their website is often broken. They cancelled two of my flights - both citing weather reasons. Once it was actually legitimate as across the board flights got cancelled. However, for the first time they had cancelled 6h ahead of time (how could you know the flight can't take off that early?) while other flights by other airlines and a bit later in the day was still able to fly. The only redeeming quality is that now their customer service line doesn't take 4h like it used to to connect to someone. Only took me 20 minutes and the person I got actually knew what they were doing. That might be a fluke and I just got lucky though, but I will certainly not be flying Air Canada anytime soon if I can help it.;"""Air Canada is really struggling lately""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible, just horrible. If you can fly with a decent company, please avoid Air Canada (I know I will). My early flight got cancelled for some obscure reason. There were two other direct flights to the same destination on the same day, but the customer service didn't bother to try and put me on them. I spoke with at least 8 different people on the phone, and they all told me different things. All were acting as if it were my fault that the company cancelled the flight. I went to the airport, trying to get on one of the direct flights. After waiting for 45+ minutes in line (only two registration stands were open), I finally got to speak to someone. The person was very rude and again acted as if I were to blame for the cancellation. Anyways, after multiple phone calls I got a flight on the same day. It was later in the day and not direct, so super inconvenient. Because of Air Canada I missed a very important event and wasted my time trying to get some response from them. Like I said, don't fly them - they are unreliable and their customer support is terrible (okay, just one out of 8 people was actually helpful - the one who helped me book a new flights).

✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst trip I’ve ever experienced in my life. It started with each flight being delayed which it didn’t really affect my trip until I was coming back to Jeddah. It started when my flight got delayed in Minneapolis causing the missing of my next flight from Montreal to Cairo. I traveled with 4 kids and it was such a mess trying to catch the flight we’ve been rerouted to which is from Montreal to Athens. I asked the agent who printed our boarding passes if my luggage will be rerouted and she said yes! After a long, hard, tiring trip and a long wait in Athens, we made it Jeddah and guess what no luggage. I checked in 12 pieces of luggage none of them arrived and the worst is that Air Canada doesn’t want to file a claim for me stating they’re not the last carrier I traveled with. The other airline company doesn’t want to file a claim for me either stating that their name is not on the baggage tags. To summarize this, Air Canada is the worst airline company I’ve traveled with in term of service, food, timing, comfort and customer service.

✅ Trip Verified |  Air Canada is terrible. I paid over $300.00 for a direct flight from Montreal to BWI. I could have purchased a ticket for $120.00 if a wanted a flight with stops. I selected the most expensive direct flight option. Thur flight got cancelled and replaced with a two flights Montreal to Toronto and Toronto to BWI. The flight from Montreal was very late. While I was in the air the second flight from Toronto to BWI got cancelled. According to the customer service no flight was available on the same day. They offered me to fly back to Montreal and from there to DC the next day. Then they instructed where to pick up my luggage. However, I couldn't find my checked in bag. I had to speak Air Canada rep and he told me that my bag got checked in for the next flight and would stay in the airport. I tried to explain that all my belongings were there but he didn't want to listen to me. I had to find an emergency accommodation and buy a few things to spend the afternoon and night in Toronto No assistance or accommodation was offered to me. Next day I flew to Montreal and I was assured that my bags were loaded on the flight. In Montreal I had to wait an hour before I was able to pass the custom office control because my luggage couldn't be found. It remained in Toronto. My flight to DC was rescheduled twice. Originally I was supposed to land around 3 PM but instead I landed after 5 PM. I still don't know where my luggage is. No compensation or even a simple apology was ever offered by Air Canada. I lost a precious vacation day because my original flight was cancelled. I had to spend extra money because my stay in Canada was extended against my will. I am feeling traumatized and abused by Air Canada. I can express how much stress and inconveniences Air Canada caused to me. They are unreliable and inconsiderate. I will never use Air Canada again. This company is a nightmare.;"""I will never use Air Canada again""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst travel experience of my life. Supposed to be heading to Germany for a work convention. Flight was delayed out of Newfoundland which made us miss our connection in Toronto. So they tried to put us on a different flight with a different company but ""couldn't"" actually transfer our tickets because they used a European operator called Eurowings and we had already ""checked in"" at our original departure. So be aware if your Air Canada flight is operated by another company because they'll use that as an excuse to screw you over. If you're reading this Air Canada rep; maybe don't make deals with other companies if you can't provide customer support. So now I'm stuck in Toronto, going to be over 24 hours late arriving to a work thing and they're doing everything not to help. Sure they gave us a hotel room for the night and $20 each in food vouchers for the airport but that doesn't begin to make up for the stress of all of this. Can't even call to get compensation because you have to ""go online"" so they can proceed to ignore your claims. Terrible company with even worse customer service.

✅ Trip Verified |  Lost luggage is a major problem for Air Canada as I learned the hard way. Lost 2/2 bags, huge line at Copenhagen airport of other Air Canada customers who similarly had lost luggage on multiple AC flights. What is most disconcerting is the number of large carts of lost luggage labeled with dates going back up to a week in full public access that had not even been touched by AC staff which makes me highly doubt the AC claim that they are doing everything they can to reunite lost luggage with travelers. If you are planning to travel with Air Canada, my advice is not to check bags right now.;"""Lost luggage is a major problem""";"

That was on July 11. It is now August 22 and I have yet to even be acknowledged, let alone refunded for my hotel.

✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly Air Canada again. Gate staff are inflexible. Our flight from Rome to Toronto was delayed thus we missed our connection to San Francisco. There were about 10 people on the flight that had to make this connection. The Staff at customer service had called the gate and let the gate staff know we were all running to the gate to make the flight and to please allow us to board. We got there 5 minutes after they closed the doors, the airplane had not moved from the gate, but they would not let us on. This I accept as I’m unclear about FAA rules once an airplane door is closed. What I don’t accept is the absolute incompetence of booking us on different flights, losing our luggage, and having absolute no remorse about treating passengers like cattle. Every nightmare you read about plane travel occurred, which I accept that it’s a difficult time for this industry, but I do not accept the rudeness of staff, total apathy to help customers.;"""I will never fly Air Canada again""";"

Not Verified | Calgary to Delhi via Toronto. This was most terrible experience I ever had with Air Canada. Worst flight and customer service ever. Less than 12 hours, I was informed that my flight has been changed. That caused my husband to auto cancel his flight. The new scheduled flight from YYC - YYZ was scheduled at 1300 but got delayed by 45 mins. which made my connection tight at YYZ. I had almost 1 hour to connect with my flight from YYZ but due to some reason, when plane reached YYZ, it didn't connected with gate for almost an hour and I had to rush to my gate with my carry-on and an infant in 10 mins. The gate was closed and I was a min. or 2 away to miss my flight to DEL. After arriving DEL, I waited for my baggage to arrive for 2 hours, no luck. I asked Air Canada for help, they wrote down my info and gave me my baggage tag numbers only not the file ref. no. My husband in YYC contacted Air Canada who registered the complaint for missing luggage and gave him file ref. no. My first red bag arrived after 5 days, which had all milk supplies for my infant. My 2nd bag was delayed and arrived after 10 days because they forgot to pick my 2nd bag. In addition, both rear wheels of the baggage arrived broken. Left wheel is missing and right wheel is not aligned with the bag. This is the WORST flight of my life. I will never fly Air Canada again.;"""Worst flight and customer service""";"

Because my connecting flight was at 6 am, we were there in the middle of the night .... waiting. After 4 the first desk agents finally showed up. I guess the one agent got out of bed on the wrong side, because she started screaming at us, like ""what is wrong with you all, you are standing in the wrong aisle, and why isn't your mask on properly, and why is your carry on so big, you'll have to check that in, and put your mask over your nose!!"" And so on. Welcome to Canada! When I had checked in my carry on, I was finally able to get to the gate. I had had a long night of waiting and not eating, but I thought it's ok, I'll get my breakfast on the fight. No food for an almost 5 hour flight. Not even a snack. Water and coffee, that's it. It confirmed everything I had already heard about Air Canada. Try to avoid at all costs!

Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. On my flight up to Toronto some of my friends coming to the same destination had their flights canceled, others had theirs delayed by 8-10 hours it was ridiculous. Don’t have so many flights if you are so understaffed. On the way back my friends and I took a plane from Halifax to Toronto and then to Houston. The Halifax one got delayed by several hours but thankfully we were able to get on an earlier one. About an hour before the flight to Houston it got canceled and then we had to book a flight for the next day. Except on my booking it said I was rebooked for a different flight the same day and didn’t have to wait. Unfortunately after waiting 4 hours they basically said “Sorry you just got tot fly tomorrow”. The help desk people were always actually very nice and seemed helpful. Our flight the next day was supposed to be at 2:30. I am currently writing this on the plane at 5:15 because there has been 3 more hours of delays and we still have no taken off.;"""Worst experience ever""";"

Not Verified |  Flew Air Canada overnight from Montreal to Heathrow. The flight back, despite the seat being rather comfortable with thanks to the extra legroom seat. The cabin crew were rather rude. I asked for a bottle of water and was told that they were able to only offer me a cup of water as they didn't have any bottles leftover. They gave me a cup of water and when I asked for a second cup, the purser told me that I was only allowed one. My food was nothing short of dreadful and came in tiny portions on plastic trays with stale bread buns. For breakfast, all that was offered was a small yogurt pot and an Air Canada special - a croissant. On the outbound flight to Canada, I flew with WestJet and they offered 2 Complimentary beverages and snack services in addition to one hot meal service on nearly a 7 hour flight and the cabin crew went out of their way to help from bringing me hand sanitizer to showing me how to work the entertainment system. At the start of the return flight, I asked for some eyeshades to sleep with to which they shrugged their shoulders and declared that they 'do not have any'. They didn't offer any snacks during the flight. On a positive note though, when I asked one flight attendent in the galley for food, they offered me a meal from the dinner service that was leftover. However, on the whole, I wouldn't fly with Air Canada on the basis that the flying experience was significantly worse than that of the vast majority of others airlines which I have flown.;"""I wouldn't fly with Air Canada""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The employees at Heathrow were wonderful and helpful. Our flight from London to Montreal was mostly uneventful except for the flight attendant yelling at people for not wearing their masks. We were instructed like children to wait until the entire row was served and the attendants had proceeded to the next row before removing masks. There were no friendly attendants. Most looked like passengers were bothering them, and they wished they were somewhere else. The flight from Montreal to Newark was horrible. This airline knows exactly how many passengers are scheduled to arrive and depart probably down to the minute, yet for multiple flights connecting through Montreal there were only 3 customs agents. The delay was nerve racking, but we were able to make it to our gate in time except, our flight was delayed. Four times. Our entire time waiting at the gate, we never saw one employee of Air Canada. We would receive a text message or email telling us our flight was delayed for 45 minutes. 30 minutes after that, we'd get another delay message. No plane was present at the gate during any of these delay messages, so I knew it was going to be much longer than 45 minutes. After 3 hours and 40 minutes of delays, several of the passengers waiting hailed an Air Canada employee briskly walking by our gate hoping to be unnoticed (she was looking at the closed bistro across from us). She did promise to get a manager. About 30 minutes later, someone shows up. She never announces anything, never talks to anyone, never asks if anyone needs assistance. My son, who has a seizure disorder, needed sleep but there were no accommodations for him and we had no idea how long the delay would ultimately be. The only restaurant in the terminal had an hour and 45-minute wait and were out of most things on the menu. There were two kiosks for fast food and drinks. Both of them were out of food and closing 20 minutes after we arrived. Finally, the gate agent that shows up starts calling zones to board. Never asks if anyone needs help, never smiled once, never even looked people in the eye. She typed fast and furious and just watched people scan their tickets to board. The attendants on the flight were the same as the previous flight. No one smiled, no one was helpful or even remotely friendly. At least they were consistent. If I have to fly out of my way next time or pay more to not fly Air Canada, I will. Traveling Is hard and expensive enough these days. I'm going to fly with an airline whose employees can at least pretend their grateful for the passengers that ultimately pay their salary. I gave them a 2 rating because we made it safely to our destination. Which is probably the only positive thing I can say about this experience.;"""No one smiled, no one was helpful""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Recently flew from Halifax to Vancouver in economy class. I booked comfort fare so I was eligible for preferred seating. I was also given the option at the time of booking to purchase a Chef Jerome meal box for $14.95. The two options looked really good so I made the purchase. Check-in was smooth, and boarding was just about on time. Seat was 20D in an exit row and offered excellent legroom, During the first (and as it turned out, only) service I was asked if I wanted to purchase anything. I said I had pre-purchased a meal and the Flight Attendant said that they weren't given a list so asked to see my boarding pass. After digging it out I showed my boarding pass which had 'meal' listed on it and she then asked what I wanted. I said I ordered the Chef Jerome meal box and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said I could select one meal and a snack so I ended up getting a cheese/fruit tray and some nuts. This was very disappointing as I was looking forward to the meal box I purchased. Furthermore, there was only 1 beverage service on this 6 1/2 transcontinental flight, which is absolutely unacceptable. There were also no Care Kits handed out like there were on my inbound flight, although perhaps these have now been discontinued. The aircraft was clean and new, although the bathrooms were not kept very clean throughout the flight. I did have a very positive interaction with one of the FAs as I was leaving the lavatory area. She asked how my flight was going, made some friendly small talk, and asked if she could get be anything which I appreciated. It was almost like she felt bad that only one service was provided. Landed on time and my checked bag arrived in a reasonable amount of time despite the airport being very busy.;"""This was very disappointing""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Used Aeroplan points to upgrade to business class for my outbound flight to Halifax. Non-business class passengers were using the priority check-in so I had to wait about 10 mins for check-in. Although priority security screening was apparently included, I was sent through the regular security line which was fine as it wasn't busy. Headed to Maple Leaf lounge, which was quite crowded. The buffet consisted of a few salads, two soups (one labeled as cream of mushroom but was clearly cream of broccoli), and a limited selection of light snacks. Wine, beer and soft drinks also offered. It was only after I noticed someone getting delivered a hot dish that you could order 2 different meals from your table. I ordered the flat bread pizza, which was ok. The other option was a vegetarian curry, I headed to the gate early but as I arrived I received a notification from AC that the gate changed so I went to the new gate. Boarding was delayed just over an hour as inbound aircraft came from the US and was at the US gates so they had to wait for it to be towed to our gate. Boarding was chaotic as ever but since I was in zone 1 I got to board right away. I was not greeted by name. I took my seat (4D, aisle seat in the last row of business class). A couple asked me to switch to 4B so they could sit together. Since it was the same seat just on the opposite side of the aisle I obliged (I like aisle seats). FAs handed out Air Canada's Care Kits before departure and they took orders for dinner. The options were a chicken dish with a rice/quinoa mix, or a vegetarian gnocchi. Pillows and blankets were handed out but they were just the cheap ones used in international economy. Cheap earbuds were also offered. The seat was clean but not at all comfortable. I booked business so I would have a more comfortable 6 hour journey overnight but I found it very uncomfortable. While the legroom was good, the entertainment box impeded my legroom. My preferred seat in economy on my return flight (separate review) was actually more spacious. Dinner was served shortly after takeoff. Since it was close to midnight at this point I really wasn't in the mood to eat but I went for the chicken dish, which was small and quite bland. Surprisingly that was the only service offered on the 6 hour flight. While I wasn't expecting another meal I did fully expect a beverage service before arrival. I am sure I could have asked for a coffee but was surprised we weren't offered another drink. They did pass out some snacks from a basket before arrival but it was mostly chips and chocolate bars, not something I wanted at that hour. The business class washroom on B737MAX aircraft are notoriously small, and Air Canada's is no different. It was kept quite clean. The Flight Attendants were efficient but not overly friendly. My checked bag arrived at the carousel in a timely fashion. Overall I was disappointed with this flight. North American business class with Air Canada is nothing special and the seat was very uncomfortable. The meal was small (which was ok as I wasn't hungry) and quite tasteless. A comfier pillow and blanket would have been appreciated for this overnight flight rather than using the same cheap ones used in international economy. North American business class with Air Canada is not worth the extra cost in my opinion. Stick to economy and splurge on a preferred seat.;"""I was disappointed with this flight"" ";"

On the flight from Delhi to Montreal, there was an old Indian lady sitting behind our seat. She either had hearing issues or she did not speak English.

✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airline I have ever flown with. Cancelled every flight due to “weather” so they don’t have to be responsible. When you go to the support desk, they tell you it’s not their problem and that they essentially don’t care what happens to you or if the flight they’ve rebooked you for days out interferes with your ability to work or see family. I will never fly Air Canada again. Worst company I’ve ever dealt with in my life.;"""worst airline I have ever flown""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  This is my first time flying Air Canada and it will be my last. My husband and I volunteered to check our luggage on the flight from Cleveland to Athens. We were told our luggage would be waiting for us when we landed. It was not. We had to go to the baggage carousel and wait almost an hour for our carry on and then go through customs and security. Members of our flight felt lied to and were very upset as we were. We were the two middle seats in the middle of the plane. There was absolutely no room and it was absolutely miserable. I almost had a panic attack about five hours in. My entertainment system did not work from the time we took off, and despite telling three flight attendants, no one cared to help me and in fact insinuated I was the one who broke it. We landed in Athens and my husband’s checked bag did not make it on the flight. It took two and a half hours to get through the line. It took him two days to get the bags back. On the way from Athens to Toronto, I tried to upgrade our seats to no avail. We were in zone 4. By the time we got on the plane, there was no overhead space left and we were told we had to check the bags. We had an hour and a half layover in Toronto and did not have time to go through customs again. I started crying and only then one flight attendant helped us put our bags in the closet up front. The seats are small for an overseas flight and it is a form of torture.;"""seats are small for an overseas flight""";"

After we passed the counter to the plane the staff came to us (4 persons with 2 small children and told us that we need to take down our luggage to the bottom of the plane. I asked the staff to make sure or to take our luggage up when we will arrive, since we know there are problem with the luggage and we are afraid that we will not receive it. The staff just told me that i have 2 choices to get down from the flight to the next flight or to put the it down with no explanation.

Not Verified |  Air Canada ruined a week long vacation to Ontario by multiple canceled/delayed flights that were so bad we said “screw it” and decided to just stay in Toronto since they couldn’t get us to our final destination after trying for 48 hours. To rub salt in our wounds, they lost our luggage! After persistently haggling with Customer Service, who had no idea where the bags were physically located (ironically they did make it to our final destination), we finally got them after 5 days (thanking Air Canada for the new wardrobe I had to buy) . And if you thought that was bad enough, to put a cherry on top of this grand disaster - they again lost our luggage on the return flight.;"""multiple canceled/delayed flights""";"

Even though their boarding pass states ""Gate closes 15 minute before"", they would not let us into the plane 35 minutes before the flight at the gate. Then they booked us for the next day husband and wife separate to make us pay for two seats next to each other still in the economy section of the plane.

"✅ Trip Verified | Lisbon to Raleigh via Montreal. On August 2, 2022 I flew business class on a ticket purchased from Air Canada beginning in Funchal, Portugal with Star Alliance partner TAP. The second flight (which was on Air Canada) was delayed more than 90 minutes leaving Lisbon due to a ""catering issue."" During the Lisbon - Montreal flight I was told by flight attendants that a gate agent would meet the flight on arrival in Montreal to help with connections which turned out not to be the case. There were no employees anywhere around where we exited nor any monitors on connecting information as all arriving international passengers had to go through immigration even before going to their connecting gate. Air Canada sent me a text since I had missed my connection in Montreal notifying me that it had automatically booked me on two new flights to replace my prior non-stop flight. There were no new boarding passes tied to the text and so I went to the Air Canada customer service desk on arrival to get my new boarding passes. The employee there said I would need to go to baggage claim and speak to a representative there first to get my bag and then I would need to recheck it on the 2 new flights. I then ran the gauntlet trying to get through passport control, Covid protocols for Canada, customs, etc only to wait in a long line in baggage claim. When I finally got to the front the agent looked up my claim ticket and said my bag should be automatically moved to the 2 new flights which was great to hear (but did not actually happen). This incredibly frustrating and time-consuming process in the Montreal airport could have been avoided if the original customer service agent had given me accurate information. By following the Air Canada customer service agents instructions I had to exit the secure area which meant technically entering Canada. This led to having to go through security (and twice disposing of liquids bought post-security at the prior airport) and their lines two more times (both in Montreal and in Toronto) as well as Canadian customs and Covid queues that I should never have had to deal with as a transiting passenger. My Montreal to Toronto flight was uneventful but then my Toronto - Raleigh flight was delayed more than 2 hrs due to supposed baggage system failure at the Toronto airport. (The Air Canada Toronto to RDU flight earlier in the day had been cancelled after passengers had boarded and sat on the plane for an hour! They then waited 6 hrs and were rebooked on my flight only to be delayed another 2 hrs) I arrived at RDU 7 1/2 hrs after my original ticketed time to find my luggage had not automatically been transferred to my new flights as the baggage agent in Montreal had claimed. With my checked bag not arriving, this required waiting in another line at RDU along with 6 other passengers whose bags also did not arrive. The baggage agent at RDU had no pre-printed forms to fill out but rather hand-wrote the information needed on blank 8 1/2 x 11 pieces of paper where we then filled in the fields needed. How hard is it to print out a standard form or even have us complete them online so that the information is not then required to be manually input? ";"""no employees anywhere""";"

Not Verified |  Hands down worst experience I’ve ever had traveling. The employees don’t know their own rules and would not let my 8 month old infant on the plane. We left our house at 4 am with a 3yr old, myself and my 8 month old. (We were all pre checked in). When we got to the the desk to check in our bags, the rude, extremely unknowledgeable women working the desk told me that my 8 month old couldn’t board the plane because she didn’t have a passport. It states on the Canada travel website as well as Air Canada that she doesn’t need one to enter the country only a government issued ID (which we had). She wouldn’t even discuss it and when I showed her prof she was wrong she continued to argue. We unfortunately are missing a family reunion now as well as a celebration of life for my grandma. I would walk to Canada barefoot before I even consider Air Canada again. Garbage from start to finish.;"""Hands down worst experience I’ve ever had traveling""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We traveled from Boston to Montreal to Delhi to Kolkata (India) and return on Air Canada business class. We were flying to Delhi on Air Canada and the last leg on Vistara. On the journey to return, Air Canada had a lot of weather problems. Our flight got canceled. The next day we ended up going on Montreal to Doha to Kolkata on Qatar business as a result. On the return, we flew Air Canada from Delhi to Montreal. Having flown Qatar business on the way over, the contrast was very clear. The lie flat beds were nice, but the air Canada attendants were pretty lackadaisical about their service. It was as if they did not care much about why they were there, just perfunctory about their service. The joy of flying wasn't there. The food was reasonable but the service just made it an average trip. Furthermore, when I arrived in Montreal, Air Canada has changed my connecting flight airplane type. Instead of a business class in a jet flight, I was changed to a propeller plane, all economy. I did not receive any compensation for this. Or, even a apology letter from Air Canada to this effect.;"""lackadaisical about their service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Calgary to Delhi via Toronto via Air Canada. While travelling from Delhi to Calgary, my parents accompanied me via wheel chair. Over the past month , i read about horror stories with Air Canada and poor staff performance. I was really scared. I had a 1:37 mins layover at Toronto, while going to Delhi. The flight from Calgary to Toronto was on time (july 22). Perfect. I got my connection to Delhi. The flight was delayed by 40 mins or so. But that did not matter. We still reached Delhi appx 30 mins ahead of scheduled landing time. On the way back from Delhi July 28th, I had my parents accompanying me. The flights were all on time. The staff in Montreal was spot on. I was impressed. Very pleasant. Very polite and efficient. But my flights both ways were appx 24 hours long and Air Canada would get a 5 star from me.

✅ Trip Verified |  I have never been treated so badly than flying with this airline.  There were three nice employees of air Canada our entire trip. However the miscommunication that occurs within air Canada is horrifying. We had to go through US customs in Toronto so we had to wait for our bags to be cleared. We were told “do not come speak to an agent unless you missed your flight or your flight was canceled” so we didn’t. And we waited for 4 hours until we finally missed our flight and still hadn’t been passed through. When we went to reschedule our flights there wasn’t a straight through so we had to make another stop and not even fly out of Toronto until the next morning. Spending the night in the airport is never fun but they made us go to the E gates and the next morning we were told “there will be someone working in customer service to escort you back up to the F gates at 4 in the morning.” Well guess what, nobody was there! Waited an hour and nobody came but luckily there were many other people waiting to get escorted also and security finally let us go through to the F gates. They also lost our bags so all that waiting for them to get checked in Dublin just so they could lose them. They delayed our flight again so now we will probably miss our next connecting flight that we wouldn’t have had if they had their act together in the first place. Air Canada turned what was supposed to be a great end of our honeymoon (18 hours of travel) into a nightmare of 36 hours of stress and exhaustion. Shout out to the few kind employees that didn’t treat us like idiots, prisoners, and overall disrespect.;"""36 hours of stress and exhaustion""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Montreal to Philadelphia. Air Canada was the worst, they kept delaying our flight till finally they said due to shortage of staff, all flights are canceled, I had a flight from Montreal to Philadelphia, not to mention flights to Philadelphia have been canceled for several days (my point is they knew, they would cancel this flight too but wouldn’t want to initiate sooner), they didn’t help passengers in any way, some people were going back and forth for 4 days, the employee at the gate reassured us that AC will refund for the flight they didn’t operate! I also had to pay extra for the luggage they didn’t deliver to the destination! I had to be in Philly and since I saw all of those passengers from previous canceled flights, I chose to rent a car and drive to Philly, car rentals charged me $480 US dollars for 24 hour, and I had to drive about 8 hours, I came to Philly, contacted them for flight and luggage refund and compensation, and they replied to me after about two weeks to tell me that it was due to pandemic and they can not refund anything, so basically they rip off the passengers, charge them for the flight THEY DIDNT OPERATE AND the baggage THEY DIDNT DELIVER! I forgot to mention that all suitcases were at the airport unsupervised, anybody could take any suitcase and there was at least 200 unclaimed suitcases there I decided to call them and I was on the line for about 3 hours and they told me that they can issue a refund and it should go through another airline!

Not Verified |  We arrived at the airport to find that the flight from Manchester was put back from 12.15 to 12.30 then to 13.15 with no explanation. When we finally started to board everything came to a stand still as there were apparently 19 passengers who had got on with boarding cards that didn't have a seat as the aircraft. We were told that the aircraft on the stand was different to the one that we were checked onto and had a different seating configuration but no-one had told the check in staff! We eventually left at 14.30 which made us very anxious about missing our connection in Toronto. We needn't have worried as the 18.55 Toronto to Vancouver flight was delayed and then cancelled. We don't have a mobile 'phone so couldn't get text or e-mails and were told very curtly by the only AC staff we could find to go to the customer service desk but when we got there the queue went into infinity and didn't move. Fortunately the people in front of us were also going to Vancouver and kindly relayed the messages that they were getting as there were no PA announcements. Not very helpful to those with no 'phones! Another flight was eventually found and was supposed to leave at 21.15 but that was delayed 3 times and eventually left at 23.30 which meant we got to Vancouver at 01.25, five and three quarter hours late. The return flight from Calgary via Toronto was not much better and got us back to Manchester only four and a half hours late. There was one AC lady in Calgary who was wonderful and helped us with our boarding card and took the checked in bag for us as we couldn't drop it off because we were outside the four hour bag drop time because they changed the flight time and we didn't know. Once on board two of the overhead lockers wouldn't shut so a mechanic had to be sent for twice, the seating was very uncomfortable, the international leg food inedible, the domestic food had to be paid for, my husbands seat back entertainment didn't work and the staff were rude and unhelpful. The only good think was the checked in case arrived on the same flight as we did which wasn't the case for a lot of people! We've tried not to let those two days travelling spoil our holiday as in between we had a great time but Air Canada, never again. ;"""seating was very uncomfortable""";"

When I flew back to Melbourne they knowingly sold me a connecting flight with not enough time to self transfer at Sydney airport. 3k for flights and I had to self transfer in 2 hrs, take a train between terminals at Sydney airport, requiring clearing customs and negotiating a 3 hr domestic check in line.

First, morning before flight they sent info that all our flights are cancelled and we have an option to fly through Istanbul but only next day. When we got to airport it turns out that flights were not cancelled but delayed by 1.5 hrs. When we got to Toronto we found out that connecting flight to Newark was cancelled. They put us on another flight to LaGuardia New York 2 hours later which was even further delayed by 3 hours. The connections hall in Toronto was a total mess. People were standing in line which was barely moving and agents just kept getting up and walking out without any disregard for passengers. On top of everything when we got to LaGuardia it turned out they've lost our luggage. When we filed claim we found out luggage was simply not put on our flight.

I suspect they knew all along but didn’t want to pass that information on. No instructions given on how to rebook or get hotel, ended up waiting six hours in line with hundreds of others in a similar situation. Ended up in a hotel at 4 am, now hoping I will be able to fly out today. Will be flying to a different airport than originally planned but I have a job so can’t just wait three days to come home.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Toronto to Atlanta was cancelled. After already flying from Asia to Toronto, this was the last leg of my journey home. The flight was cancelled without an announcement at the gate; the flight was simply removed from the departures board. I received a text notification of the cancellation about 2 hours after it was cancelled. At this point, I also received an email with a rebooked flight with a connection for the following day where I would arrive in Atlanta in early afternoon. Since I had to work that day, this was insufficient for my travel needs. There was no agent at the gate to help with rebooking. The wait for customer service was over an hour as stated on the customer service line when I called. Thus, while staying on line with customer service, I was told I needed to go through Canadian customs as I could not stay in the gate area overnight. I went to the Air Canada customer service desk and waited in line for about an hour. At this point, an Air Canada employee walked around handing out customer service business cards and stated that the customer service desk was closing for the day. No one ever answered the customer service line. I had to book a flight on Delta for first thing the next morning to get me to work on time. Once home, I submitted an online customer service request for reimbursement. It has been 26 days and I have yet to receive a reply. Today, I called the customer service phone number provided, which went to reservations. I was told there was no one in customer service I could speak with. I was also told that because I booked my ticket through priceline, all reimbursement requests would need to go through priceline.

✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly with them again. In these times, flying is not going to go smoothly - this I expected. What I did not expect was the lack of respect, compassion, and assistance from the staff. They were rude to my travel agent and to my friend and I when all we asked for was directions in Montreal Airport on arrival. This lead to it taking us 5 hours to exit the airport. ;"""5 hours to exit the airport""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  My trip with Air Canada has been a nightmare. Our flights were cancelled a week before our trip citing “labour shortages.” Once we finally rebooked, we found out only hours before our flight that it was so delayed, we would miss our connecting flight and had to frantically rebook everything again. Our new itinerary included being stranded in the airport lobby overnight because we weren’t allowed to recheck our bags or go through security as our delayed flight caused us to arrive after all the check-in counters were closed (11:00pm). We were told to come back to the counter at 2:30am and by 4am, there were still no employees in sight.;"""My trip has been a nightmare""";"

Not Verified |  They don't respect peoples time. I had four flights with them all were delayed, everyone lost their connections, and there were no AC agent at the airport to help us. I witnessed lots of family dramas and disappointed passengers, rude staff and many more. Air Canada has the poorest customer service. When I wrote to their customer care they offered nothing for a 15-hour delay in flights and they just said the events were out of our control!;"""has the poorest customer service""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  First delay notification came 6 hours prior to the flight due to cabin cleaning issues, once the flight was actually supposed to leave at the delayed time, the announcer indicated they have overbooked the flight and will be kicking people off and facing further delays due to baggage spacing. Then we get another delay notification due to crew members being MIA, followed by another delay due to ""operational issues"". How can you over book flights with a digital system with seat numbers and counts? While typing this I received a 4th delay notice still due to cabin crew being MIA. 44 minute long flight is now more than 200% delayed. Treated like cattle for a premium paid service, not to mention we just spent 80% of our two week vacation without any luggage, because Air Canada lost it. ";"""Treated like cattle""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Our itinerary was a very poor experience for us. We dealt, almost exclusively, with rude staff. And when it wasn't being directed at us, it was toward other passengers. We encountered rolling delays, for which we were given bizarre explanations. For example, we were told that embarkation was awaiting the plane to ""cool down"" because it was ""a little warm"". This delay was allegedly ten minutes, though would actually be thirty. All this was after three initial delays (each 45-60 minutes). Once on the plane, it would be almost another hour before wheels up. Overall, a very unpleasant experience which caused an almost 30 hour delay in our travel plans. Further, we understand that their refund policy is not very customer friendly.  If they grant us a travel voucher, we will regard it as a loss. ";"""a very poor experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a round trip flight from MCI to IST and return flight from AYT to MCI, Air Canada from MCI to Toronto was delayed for 30 min. Air Canada from Toronto to Manchester was delayed for two hours and 15 min. That was why I lost the next flight from Manchester to Istanbul, and I lost my two checked in bags as well. I received a text message from Air Canada that I would receive my two checked in bags in Istanbul, while in reality I should have received the checked in bags in Manchester and check them in again for Turkish flight. I filed a claim in Istanbul airport, and I have to call multiple times until I get my bags, I received the bags after 3 days.;"""I lost my two checked in bags as well""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was the final leg of our journey from Rome to Honolulu via Munich and Vancouver. All of our flights were delayed, we flew Lufthansa from FCO to MUC, then MUC to YVR. Our final leg from YVR to HNL was with Air Canada. Our flight from MUC to YVR was delayed leaving MUC, and landing at YVR. Going through customs and immigration at YVR was long and frustrating. Looking at the Departure screen our flight AC 519 to HNL was in the final boarding process. I asked the AC agent on duty at the passenger screening what could be done to insure my wife and I didn't miss our flights. She escorted to the head of the line. After going through security, it was then through passport control, then customs, very time consuming due to the large amount of people. By the time we cleared customs, there was an Air Canada agent with a cart to take us to our gate. What a very nice touch. We arrived at gate E80, we were the last people to board, even on the screen our names were displayed for last call. We were able to board the plane thanks to the assistance of the ground and cabin staff. Air Canada's service was remarkable and I can't thank them enough for their service and their going out of their way to get us onboard our flight. The 737max8 is such a quiet, comfortable aircraft, and quite roomy. To all the staff of Air Canada at YVR and to the flight crew aboard AC flight 519, thank you so much for a job well done and for all your assistance.;"""thank you so much for a job well done""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airline that exists, the crew was rude to me, the food is average. If you call customer service they tell you that the waiting time is 2 hours.  I flew Miami Montreal Athens, what a nightmare, the first delayed flight, I was able to make the connection because all their flights are delayed. Back I had a layover of 3 hours and I spent all of them making lines in the corridors of the airport trying to check point for American citizens, something incredible. On my last flight Montreal Miami I had upgraded my seat to one in aisle since I had come from a 10 hour flight and I wanted to be more comfortable and when I finally got to the counter they changed my seat to one in the middle and told me that they would make me a refund. It was not about the refund but that I had paid and chosen a seat and they changed me without any explanation. Extremely rude plane crew, really do yourself a big favor and avoid this airline.;"""The worst airline that exists""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We were flying from Toronto to Seattle with stopover in Vancouver on July 1, 2022. Flight AC103. Our flights was supposed to leave at 8:15. At approx. 7 am we received a sms that our flight was delayed until 10 am. Since we had to embark on Alaskan cruise on July 2nd I went to the Customer service and asked them if they could bump us to an earlier flight so we won't miss our connecting flight in Vancouver. She said no because we had checked luggage. We've waited and at 9 am we've got another text message that our flight won't leave until 1 pm. We waited again and at need we got a message that our flight is cancelled.  When approached the Customer service I was told the they have no idea when and how Air Canada will send us to Vancouver. When I pointed out that we have a cruise coming next day and we must be in Seattle by the end of the day July 1st they said that it cannot be guaranteed. I went to Air Canada website and found a direct flight Toronto-Seattle leaving at 7pm. I brought this information to them and asked us to bump us (there were free seats) to this flight. They said no because there were only seats in business class available. We couldn't understand why we cannot be upgraded for free to the business class if Air Canada cancelled our flight. Long story short we were told that if we want to be on the flight AC543 Toronto-Seattle we need to buy  tickets to business class! Since we couldn't miss our cruise we did that paying about CAD5,300. We went upstairs to Air Canada Counter and asked to redirect our luggage to Seattle with our new flight AC543. We did this twice with two Air Canada employees and they both reassured us the we are going to get our baggage (with all our clothes for cruise - active, dressy, casual, toiletries etc.) When we got to Seattle no need to say our bag was lost. Today's in July 12 and it's still sitting in Seattle (we got a call this morning). So we had to go to department stores and buy pretty much everything.;"""why we cannot be upgraded for free""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly Air Canada again. I had a horrible experience on the second leg of my flight -- Toronto to London, Ontario on 6/20/22. I received text messages every 20-30 minutes indicating the flight was delayed, only to have them send a text hours later that the flight was cancelled - at about 11:20 p.m. This was followed by another text indicating I was rebooked on another flight on the 23rd. I could have walked to my final destination in less time. Myself and other passengers were left stranded in the airport with no help. After much wandering, I finally found an Air Canada employee who was unable to help, but directed me to another area, where there was no one to help. I eventually made my own plans to get to my destination. To add insult to injury, today, Air Canada informed me I would not be reimbursed for my cancelled flight because it was due to weather. At no point in the many texts I received or announcements that were made was weather mentioned. Days before my return flight, scheduled for 6/30/22, I received notification that my flight from London to Toronto, Ontario was cancelled, and had to make arrangements to get to Toronto to catch my flight home. I suppose they'll find a way to blame something not covered for that cancellation as well, despite the fact that I incurred additional charges in order to get it. The indifference shown to paying passengers is unforgivable. They literally just stole our money, inconvenienced us, and are responsible for additional expenditures since they left the entire flight stranded. ;"""I will never fly Air Canada again""";"

"Not Verified | Manchester to Calgary via Toronto. I am writing this review on behalf of my elderly parents. The entire experience from Air Canada has been horrible. My Father had all ETA visas needed, confirmed online by CIC and because of a glitch in (I assume) Air Canada software was unable to board the flight. My mother had to board by herself. Delays at all ends both times. First delay caused the missed connection at Toronto. No hotel was offered, 33 hour journey, had to sleep on floor of airport. My father was rebooked and was refused 2nd leg of transfer in Belgium. Leaving him stranded overnight. Eventually got back home to UK next day totally exhausted and literally near collapse. No explanation can be given as to why he was (a) refused to board in the UK and (b) was allowed to fly via Air Canada from Man. and subsequently denied boarding on the 2nd flight to Toronto. All flights were operated by Air Canada. Tried to call Air Canada help desk and was on hold for 4 hours, yep that's right, 4 hours! Phone eventually stopped playing music and went to dead tone. As I write this I am just hoping that the flight from YYC to Toronto isn't delayed for longer than the 45 mins stated. If it is then the whole ordeal will start again. My advice, if you have no other option but to use Air Canada, get to the airport the day before. The only word I can use to describe the whole experience would be ""ordeal"". Covid may have started this but greed has been the driving force behind this terrible experience. I am not going to rest until I have every penny of compensation legally allowed. Needless to say the next time we spend thousands of dollars on air travel we not be using Air Canada. I simply think they are incompetent. Rant over.";"""they are incompetent""";"

Not Verified |  This is the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of trying to work with. We had a group of 31 people, their pilot decided to up and leave an hour before our flight. We tried to call Air Canada to get this resolved, but guess what, they don't actually have a customer service at all apparently. The reps at the airport are contracted and really have no sway over their system at all. Air Canada to this day has still not worked with us or helped us get to our destination. Good luck speaking with someone, I honestly don't know how a company like this is able to still operate.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The experience for my wife and I was bad; the kiosks were non functional, not easy to follow (bad user experience design), check-in staff were very sub-par and lacked the emotional intelligence to respond accordingly with non working kiosks, even with the queue elongating. They also would not assign me and my wife next to each other with regards to seats on the plane. What kind of airline lacks the awareness of assigning seats to people when a ticket for a couple or family is bought together. And then at the gate, it’s the same for the staff. The whole crew is so underwhelming and the experience is just overall negative. It’s really sad that common customer service experience cannot be provided.

✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to make a complaint. It's funny how things are! When Air Canada sends us an email from the CEO explaining that we may be facing some delays or even cancellations of some flights, and this email is an early apology, and in this same email they ask us to be understanding. However, when the situation is the opposite, that for some reason we cannot travel on the scheduled date and we call to try to reschedule the flight, Air Canada imposes absurd fees for changing the flight. My wife had surgery on June 24th, at first it was supposed to be a simple surgery and the next day she could leave the hospital. However, after the surgery, my wife had complications and almost lost her life, having to spend 5 days in the ICU, having to receive a blood transfusion, losing more than 7 kg. But luckily the worst is over and now she is recovering at home. We have all the information about the surgery and what happened, and a letter from the doctor asking my wife to postpone her return to Canada. She was supposed to return now on June 24th, the doctor requested something around 30 more days for her to fully recover. Based on this, I called Air Canada's medical office to request a change to her flight, and I was informed that this situation was not a medical situation and that they cannot change the ticket. That I should contact the call center, normally as if it were a normal situation. So, I called and talked to an attendant, he said that I should pay a difference of 800 dollars if I wanted to change the ticket for the given date. My wife's ticket has 3 destinations, Foz do Iguacu to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Toronto, and Toronto to Ottawa. I asked if it would be possible to change all these trips to just one direct trip from Sao Paulo to Montreal, but I was informed that the fee to make this change would be 1800 dollars.;"""absurd fees for changing the flight""";"

Was on hold with them every day for a month to try to get my newly wed wife and I to simply be sitting together (TLDR didn't end up happening even at check-in when we begged for it much to their indifference), they fed us 2 times in a 16 hour flight, which, mind you, was pushed to 16 from 14 because they made an unexpected stop to ""refuel"" literally a few kilometres from our destination, likely because they wanted to save time for an upcoming flight, at the comfort and convenience of their current passengers. Attendants rude as always (noticed this trend in my last few flights with this airline) and could be audibly heard mocking passengers. Abhorrent.

"Not Verified |  I don't suggest you fly with this company. The reasons I'm rating with 1 star are the following. I had a flight from Greece to Montréal and then I had to change flights to grab another one from Montréal to Los Angeles the same day just one hour away from the arriving time of the first flight. When we landed in Montréal they told us that our next flight got cancelled and that you have to re do the whole procedure from the start. After waiting in lines for 2 hours (after a 10 hour long flight) an Air Canada staff member comes to the line to tell us that we will not be able to catch a flight on this day and that we should book a hotel. She told us all the hotels are booked here so ""go figure it out"". As you can imagine this caused a lot of anger as it was unacceptable. Oh! They said the reason our flight got cancelled was due to ""lack of staff due to covid"". I guess hiring extra hands in times of need are too much of a cost for a small company like Air Canada. Anyway after 100 passengers waiting in line to book their already paid for flight complained she went on to talk with an Air Canada manager. When she returned she told us that we will wait in line to rebook our flight as we were already doing and that we are going to go to a hotel for the night (she then proceeded to give us a list of hotels). She told us to keep the receipt and that Air Canada will refund you for your stay there. ""You just need to call this number"". (She gave us a number to call). I paid 250$ for a night at a hotel. Traffic was so high due to cancelled flights that you couldn't get a room easily. I was tired and frustrated so I got this hotel. Long story short I've been calling for the past 3 days to get my refund and Air Canada puts me on hold with an estimated waiting time of 3 hours. I called reservations (they were the only ones that picked up) to tell them what's happening. They said ""Yeah you have to wait 3 hours but then you will definitely get service"". I told them there's no way that's ok to say! I asked for an email that I can contact for possibly skipping the phone call and they told me ""No you have to wait on your phone call"".

When we landed, my mom got a notification that our connecting flight from Toronto to Chicago was canceled. Now, this is common, but the next flight we were booked for was for the next morning, and it didn't even go to Chicago. It set us up so we go from Toronto to New York and to Chicago. We went to the luggage pick-up place and found 1/3 luggage. We rented a car and drove home to Chicago. Now, do note that that entire time we were going from one line to another over the span of many hours. That was a week ago, we still don't have our luggage, and the tracking thing shows that they still haven't been found. We heard that thousands of lost luggage are getting accumulated at the airport with no practical way of digging them out. We assume that our luggage is most likely at O'Hare. Most of my clothing is in there, and we have several valuables there too. This is the story for many others. We met a man who also had his flight canceled, but he was rebooked to a flight for two days later. Don't think you can just get a hotel there either.

"Not Verified |  Their website doesn't work, neither does their app, Air Canada's website is atrocious. You often try to buy a ticket, only for the booking to fail right at the point of purchase. The app is also prone to failure when buying a ticket. The custom support waits are terrible (50 minutes on hold, and they'll hang up on you). Other things that suck: try adding a credit card from the mobile app if you live in Washington, DC. Sorry, there's no ""District of Columbia"" state or ""Washington DC"" state that you can choose. You're just stuck if you're trying to use the mobile app. Sometimes you're told that the purchase didn't go through, only to find out that you did buy tickets. Better double-check under your bookings on the website, except that webpage often fails to load too. I couldn't find a way to use airline vouchers to pay for flights in the mobile app. You'll have vouchers because when you issue a refund - sometimes you don't get a refund on your credit card. Instead you get groups of $2000 vouchers. The rules for vouchers are also esoteric. Those are the things that suck from my most recent interactions with Air Canada.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible experience. Tossed on Standby then the flight took off with a seat for me and others on Standby. We were then abandoned in the airport told to see area after area until morning came 14hrs later and management arrived. Finally got re-booked and then booked the airport hotel which I was told I am ""owed"" which was a $500 nap that I haven't been reimbursed for. My bags in the ""Standby holding"" were also lost, I couldn't immediately retrieve them. How is that even possible? It's been 15 days and my things are are still lost; I have been travelling with nothing more than a backpack and a grocery bag of clothes. They have to be the worst most disorganized airline in existence. Avoid Air Canada at all costs.";"""most disorganized airline""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Venice to Toronto was 2 hours late. Fortunately I had a long layover, but many other passengers missed their connection. My flight from Toronto to san Francisco was also 2 hours late. The airport in Toronto was a mess: flights by Air Canada were hours late. The flight from Venice to Toronto is 10 hours, and many screens (including mine) were not working. When I tried to politely ask for information, the flight attendant was extremely rude. The onboard WiFI for messaging - which is usually free in other airlines - cost around 9 USD per hour.  Avoid this airline at all costs.;"""many screens were not working""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Have had a totally horrible experience with Air Canada. They cancelled a flight on us due to mechanical issues and did not send notification of rebooking. Rebooked us for the next day but we couldn't get a in touch with anyone from reservations or support to see if there were other options as we had the flexibility to try another airport in the area. No one at the airport could help and they directed us to phones that supposedly went to their reservations support team. The phones said someone would answer quickly, but there were people there who had been on hold for more than an hour. After waiting on hold for over an hour, we gave up and went with the rebooking. Additionally, since the cancellation was due to a mechanical issue, we asked for a hotel voucher. They said they would not give it to us. We had traveled one way to Alaska for a cruise and this was the end of the cruise in Vancouver and we were trying to get home. They viewed this as we were ""originating"" our trip in Vancouver and therefore would only give us a voucher for a taxi to take us home and bring us back for the flight. Totally ridiculous. Then gave us a card to contact customer relations to get a reimbursed for the hotel and meal. Tried calling the phone number and it is not in service. ";"""a totally horrible experience""";"

Not Verified |  If you are thinking of flying Air Canada, you’re a total idiot. This airline is terrible! I had been out internationally. When I woke up the day of traveling, I get a whole email completely changing it all. I arrived in Montreal and instead of going straight to my destination with a 1 hour wait, they made a 16 hour wait. We had to pay for a hotel, which by the way was expensive. And instead of going straight to my destination, they put us in Houston for 1 hour. The service is also terrible. On a a regular plane, the snacks cost money and they are very  rude about serving drinks. An international plane is nothing better. The food is terrible and on top of that they lost our baggage! Our baggage didn’t arrive. It was a waste of money and now we don’t even know if we are going to get our bags back.;"""This airline is terrible!""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased a ticket with them and after 1 day they canceled it before my departure, saying it was due Covid entry policy. They shouldn’t sell the ticket if it’s not available. Afterwards, they wouldn’t process refund for over a month and I had to fill out a form and provide passport copy etc. If you cancel my ticket, refund instantly and immediately! The staff says they process these manually. Such a joke with and lack of modern technology.;"""wouldn’t process refund for over a month""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  A solid performance. The typical 10 minute delay from Taipei was the only glitch. Anew aircraft, flatbed Business class seats, gracious service and decent food all contributed to the quality of this flight. Avoiding a change in Bangkok is a big plus as well. This airline tries hard to be world class and usually seems to succeed. Whether long, medium, or short haul they strive for greatness and it is appreciated.;"""A solid performance""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I haven't flown with them for more than a decade because I normally fly with SQ. However the overnight flight to Hokkaido via Taipei is a convenient route. It means transferring in Taipei rather than Tokyo and a transfer in Taipei is pretty comfortable.  The website and app is functional but slightly less seamless than the SQ app.  It was easy to choose seats and special meals and check details. The service from the crew was excellent. The quality of the food was excellent. The lounge in Taipei is pretty good. The buffet appears small in size but the variety is impressive. Plus the kitchen has a good menu of fresh noodle soups and the like. I'd rank it above almost any other lounge when it comes to quality and variety. Seat comfort was the same as the SQ flat bed seats. They are a bit firm. I found the manual fold down beds to be more comfortable compared to these electronic fully reclining beds. There is in flight wifi included. The in flight entertainment may be less extensive than top ranked airlines. For a 9 hour overnight flight it doesn't matter. I'm yet to take the onward flight to Sapporo so maybe my opinion will change. But so far I am nothing but impressed.;"""I am nothing but impressed""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Our trip was Calgary- Vancouver - Taipei -Philippines. I have only good things to say about this airline. I paid for a premium economy seats to provide more comfort to my toddler and it sure did not disappoint. My daughter was very comfortable playing on the floor during the reminder of our time flying to Taipei. No complains on the food as well. My daughter was provided with an adult sized meal when I told Them that she can solid food. The flight attendees were very polite and helpful especially for me who is flying alone with a one year old. I got a lot of extra hands whenever needed. It was a long haul flight but the flight attendants see to it that clean washrooms would still be available to the passengers. I would also like to commend the China airlines crew in Manila, they were all giving exemplary service, they made sure that the passengers understood the process of boarding and transferring airlines;"""only good things to say""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Long trip to get from Europe to Jakarta, but relatively price worthy. Wonderful interiors on both flights, with nice welcoming colours. Food out of Frankfurt quite poor in quality and quantity. In between the meals, no snacks offered on this very long flight, except for some crackers. Generous offerings for drinks if you asked. On the contrary the proactive mid-flight runs to keep passengers hydrated (trays with water and orange juice) weren’t many. Unproblematic transfer in Taipei for the onward journey to Jakarta. Food served on this quite turbulent flight was far better (and larger) than the longer one from Frankfurt to Taipei.

While in Australia China Airlines cancelled the return leg Taipei to Hong Kong. I made 2 phone calls and 1 email to their Taipei office explaining that I still wanted to continue with the Brisbane to Taipei leg. Before the flight I received and email stating the refund would be HK$ 4055. At Brisbane I was advised by China Airlines staff to make my own ongoing arrangements. After there flight I received another email saying the refund was now HK$ 460, which is 3.7% of the ticket cost. Really bad customer service at Brisbane and Taoyuan airport and subsequently through emails.;"""Really bad customer service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Vancouver via Taipei. First time flying on China Airlines after Expedia mistakenly cancelled our Air Canada booking. We were impressed with the aircraft which looked new and most up to date entertainment system. Our family enjoyed the food, even our children finished their meals and they're picky. What I was most impressed with was their customer service and ability to help us change flights in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic that occurred while we were away. Due to closing borders where we were scheduled to be on our way back home, we had to change our flight to a direct flight back home and we wanted to leave as early as possible. We could get never get through to Expedia at all (after hours on the phone) but China Airlines customer service was more than helpful and they were able make our changes for us and get us home even though we booked through Expedia. Next time I travel to Asia, I would consider China Airlines as a top choice carrier. ;"""help us change flights""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Myself my mother and my husband flew Gatwick to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines but will never fly with them again. The cabin crew on the first leg of the journey did not speak hardly at all. We could not hear nor understand the announcements so in an emergency it would have been guess work which I find astounding but in general I think its poor customer service. The food was just awful, I know it was 95% Chinese passengers but I think the airline should look at the list of people and cater for those who don't want to eat soggy rice and chicken on both the inbound and outbound flights. The blankets provided were a dirty mustard colour and were way past their use date. The cabin crew all were wearing face masks to protect themselves and passengers but found it totally unhygienic that they wiped down the toilet floors, units and toilet with paper towels and no gloves on, that to me was not only disgusting but a health and safety issue. Overall we all found our experience with China Airlines a very poor one. Never again to be repeated.;"""found it totally unhygienic""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  They have no regard for consumer rights and will destroy your itinerary if they dont have enough passengers. Booked a flight for my wife, 3yr old and myself, directly with China Airlines via their webpage for a flight from Singapore to Takamatsu. This included a layover of 20hrs in Taipei which we also booked a nights stay at a hotel for. 1 month prior to departure they brought forward by a day, our TPE to TAK flight. As they did not change the Singapore to TPE flight the connection is now impossible. They rectified the problem by changing our SIN to TPE flight a day earlier but refused to make up for our lost hotel booking. We rebooked our hotel at our own cost. 11 days before departure, they changed our TPE to TAK flight again bringing it forward by 24hrs and again neglecting to make the appropriate amendment for SG to TPE. They have also again refused to compensate us in any way for having to book a hotel for the 3rd time. Warning! It looks cheap and respectable. It is a lie.;"""no regard for consumer rights""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The check-in in this case was a bit more complex, because my flight ability in Taipei had to be obtained through a stay in China. However, this can be assessed as positive for the health of other passengers. Departures and arrivals were on time. The A330 made a somewhat older impression and the seat pitch was below average. In the A350, on the other hand, cleanliness, comfort and seat spacing were good. The on-board entertainment left nothing to be desired and relatively new films were shown. Catering and drinks are very good and extensive. The staff friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience.;"""seat pitch was below average""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Ho Chi Minh city to Frankfurt via Taipei, a good experience overall. I departed at 05:45 p.m., and meals were served 3 times, 1 dinner in the connecting flight from HCMC to Taipei and 2 on the flight from Taipei to Frankfurt. The food was good, but there were not many options and the menu was the same for both departing and returning flights. The crew were friendly and caring, they noticed when I felt uncomfortable due to low temperature inside the cabin and offered hot drinks. The seat was comfortable. I'm a rather small girl (162cm in height), so I had no problem with legroom, but it might have been a bit cramped for some other passengers around me. My returning date was a busy day for Frankfurt airport, so I had a delayed takeoff, which made me miss my connecting flight from Taipei to HCMC. I had a long delay at Taoyuan airport. The airlines handled the situation well, they offered me to stay in their lounge and took care of my baggage, coupons for food and bevarage were also given. The best part was I was upgraded to Premium economy on my flight back to HCMC. ;"""I was upgraded to Premium economy""";"

Not Verified |  Taipei to Frankfurt. I am really upset about China Airline customer service and the abuse of regulations. I book my tickets via Expedia, and Expedia asks their users to input the names as: Family name, Middle Name, First Name. I input as it asks and they arrange my name as Western Order by Family name First Name Middle Name. This is a common way, even western government department does this to Asian name order. When I booked my ticket, Expedia forwarded my info to China Airline and I got charged 100€ for changing my name on the tickets. I booked through Expedia all the time with other Airlines and there has been no problem. With the pressure in the airport, I had to pay. Later I contact China Airline with this complaint and they act like this is my fault. That is really ignorant attitude from China Airlines. I explained to them in details, and they were pushing the problems to their regulation and Expedia. I am sure this is a systematic problem between Expedia and China Airlines, however the customer is the one that is blamed and paid the money. They reject my claim and complaint and complaint but doesn’t do better than abusing their regulations towards customers. As my first time flying, I feel mistrusted towards this airline.;"""customer is the one that is blamed""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Taipei. I fail to understand why this flight and the return leg arrived at and departed from Terminal 2. The ticket specifies Terminal 1, Immigration and baggage delivery are at Terminal 1 and the return check-in is at Terminal 1. This is not the first time this has happened on a CI flight. So why does CI not have proper facilities in Terminal 2 or mark the ticket information as Terminal 2? As far as I am aware, on arrival at TPE there was no announcement on the aircraft and no printed announcement on the video monitors. Passengers were therefore left with a weakly written and seemingly unimportant sign on exiting the Gate ramp. But a China Airlines attendant stood right in front and in the middle of that sign rendering it impossible to read. And her main job seemed to be to direct passengers en route to a soon departing Fukuoka flight since the Bangkok flight had arrived late. The only sign exiting passengers can easily see is the bright illuminated sign above stating that for Immigration passengers should turn right. That, though, is for Terminal 2 Immigration and baggage claim. The handwritten sign that should be in very large thick clear lettering easily visible to all disembarking passengers pointed out that those going to Terminal 1 should actually turn left and then walk a very long way. A staff member giving instructions in Chinese is of little use to those not conversant in the language! Having been caught out by this once before and wasted almost an hour, after this flight I stopped and took time to check the sign carefully. This unthought-through action apart, the flight was smooth and the meal very tasty. My only other gripe about China Airlines is the headphones for the IFE. It makes available the ancient circular ones. I accept these fit nicely into the ears of a majority of passengers. But not all ears are the same and they just don’t fit mine at all. So even though this, with a weather delay, was only a 4-hour flight, watching anything on the IFE was out of the question.;"""no announcement on the aircraft""";"

This aircraft is small and old. The F&B is not good, very bad. The staff is not helpful. They don’t support the passengers. I needed to change the middle seat to aisle seat, but they ask me for charging money.  I didn’t request change to another higher class seat, just same economy. When I get aboard, I saw 4 empty seat around me. ;"""I never use again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei. Check-in at LAX was smooth. They gave us a transfer sleeve to store boarding passes for later segment, which was a nice touch. We had a remote gate far away and had to be shuttled by bus. That experience wasn't very pleasant as we had to wait inside the bus for a very long time. Despite having reservation for four seats (traveling as a family), there was no available overhead storage. All four of us had requested special meals, but the flight attendants started serving us regular meal. It was only after we showed them our boarding passes that they served our special meals. The overall ambiance, seating comfort, and IFE were excellent. Both B777-300ER and A330-300 were tastefully decorated. The service between Taipei and Bali segment was far superior to what we experience between LA and Taipei. The service on our final segment from TPE to LAX fell below the mark. The flight attendants serving us in economy didn't smile and were quite rude while interacting with us. So, while friendly service was absent in TPE-LAX segment, the WiFi worked well on B777-300ER. Overall, China Airlines offered an inconsistent experience where the positives outweighed the negatives, so we will still fly with them again.;"""an inconsistent experience""";"

Our plane was late getting into Taipei from Los Angeles and we had just enough time to disembark and walk to the gate of our connecting flight to be the last persons to board. I told my wife that I was sure our luggage wasn’t going to make the connection. I sat down at my window seat and watched the last of the luggage being loaded but did not see ours. The cabin door closed and I expected us to leave but we didn’t. I could see the baggage handlers impatiently waiting for something. Alas, 10 minutes later a buggy showed up with our luggage and was quickly loaded and we were then on our way. Our flight ended up late and although I felt a little guilty we really appreciated our luggage arriving with us. The food we just ok.

"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Taipei. This is the worst flight I've ever been on in my life.  I got a discount on this flight, and the stewardesses were nice. Everything else about was a nightmare. I called a week in advance and had to pay for the desired seat I wanted for $30 extra because this airline doesn't let you choose your seat. But they ended up giving me the wrong seat anyway, rather than 40E, which is larger. They could not fix the issue on the plane, so I was stuck with the tiny seat and wasted my $30. Some seats can lift the armrest, but the one I had to go to could not and was quite uncomfortable. I then learned that this was the first flight I've been on that doesn't offer free WiFi. I had to pay $50 (specifically $43.90) to use their very bad WiFi service. The ""entertainment"" tablet doesn't work, even if you rub it or clean it, and there's nothing on there you've ever heard of, anyway. The food looked inedible, but that's okay because I opted not to eat anyway. It just sucks you have to pay for water, since TSA obviously doesn't let you bring any liquids on. Guess I should've brought a bigger water bottle.  Sixteen hours of this, and they don't even offer you WiFi or working power outlets (though I'm surprised we even had those). This airline just seems cheap, even if their actual prices aren't that cheap. ";"""worst flight I've ever been on""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Honolulu via Taipei. I fly regularly between Honolulu and Bangkok, but I've never flown on China Airlines. However, it emerged as the least-expensive option for a recent trip and since the price and flight schedules were good I decided to give the airline a try, despite some hesitation. I was mostly pleasantly surprised by the airline: Though the staff seem to be unable to smile and service both on the ground and in the air is bare-bones, the A350 is a fabulous aircraft, the seats were mostly comfortable, and the entertainment system was alright. There were a few negative experiences: For instance, not one single flight arrived or departed on time; The airline's pillows and blankets are pitiful, and the catering is mostly inedible; China Airlines has the serving style favored by many Asian airlines, wherein a few drinks choices are offered on top of the meal service trolleys, and if a passenger requests anything not on top of the trolley, the flight attendants tend to lie and say they ran out. It's very, very tedious to constantly have to ask and remind them for something as simple as a can of Coke Zero, and for it to be brought with a scowl. I arrived at Taipei from Honolulu in the middle Typhoon Mitag; My onward flight to Bangkok that evening was cancelled and I was expecting a chaotic, uncomfortable evening in Taipei's airport. Much to my surprise, the situation had been rather expertly arranged before my arrival: An agent met our flight and informed all of us going to Bangkok that we had been rescheduled for a flight the following morning and that accommodation had been arranged for us for that evening. I was impressed by the efficiency of China Airlines and the Taipei airport authorities, and I commend them for their handling of a difficult situation. In all, I recommend China Airlines because of the very low cost paid for this set of flights. While China Airlines certainly pales in comparison to ANA, JAL, EVA Air, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines, it is at least as good as Korean Air.";"""mostly pleasantly surprised""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. The onboard experience was fine. The problem with this airline is the ground customer service and code-share system. I have no idea why, but China Airlines would not allow me to select my seats in advance or even change my seats at check-in. It seems that some tickets simply do not have an online check-in or seat selection option. You are forced to get to the check-in desk when it opens (about 3hrs before a flight) and try to get them to change the seat they assign to you. This creates a mad rush at check-in, and a strong likely-hood of not sitting with your companion and getting the middle seat. This is exactly what happened to me in Taipei. I flew in on a code-share flight with Vietnam Airlines. There was no online check-in option for the China Airlines portion of the flight. At check-in in Saigon, China Airlines automatically assigned my wife and me to two middle seats in different rows (not together). I asked the Vietnam Airlines agent if we could change the seat assignments, but they were unable to access seating for China Airlines. When I got to Taipei for the connection, I went to the China Airlines office to change the seats, and they said all seats were assigned and the flight was full, but that the boarding counter could probably do something. I went to the boarding gate, and they said they would make a note of this. I asked what that meant, and they said they would tell the stewardess. I asked what that meant, and they said the stewardess would look for spare seats. I asked why they couldn't see if there were any spare seats, and the boarding gate said they could, and there were none, 'but maybe someone would be too sick to fly'. There was no attempt to look for people that were willing to move from one seat to another to accommodate my wife and I sitting together. No effort what so ever, they just wanted to tell me they took my name. The boarding agents said it was a common problem that people could not check-in online or select their seats in advance. The boarding agents even laughed as I walked away. The problem is not just the boarding agents, its China Airlines inability to allow online check-in or seat selection on booking flights. I'm not sure why they don't have a system that would do this? Regardless, I will not fly with this airline again.;"""not fly with this airline again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Vienna to Auckland via Taipei and Brisbane. I am very happy with the experience . I flew in Economy Class, at the height of 1,83m / 6ft I had enough legroom. Vienna to Taipei I was offered to change my original seat to a seat in a row which was completely free (I did manage to sleep a couple of hours on this flight as I could kind of lie down during the flight.) The remaining two flights were fully booked and if 3 men sit next to each other, there is not too much space in Economy class but it did not feel uncomfortable. The cabin crew was very friendly and the service was very good. I enjoyed the meals and the in-flight entertainment. The A350-900 is a great and modern airplane I can definitely recommend.;"""service was very good""";"

Will never fly with China airlines again, flight attendants are rude no common courtesy, get into your personal space without warning no ""excuse me"" no nothing! Felt like a harrasment because I purchased a premium economy seats for my infant and have to argue back and forth about it because they didn't believe my 1,5 year old is not 2 years old, I bought 3 premium economy seats for my 2 kids and I but they only gave me 2 meals and not counting my other kid! Their excuse is they don't have infant food even tho I told them my 1,5 year old can eat anything, asking me to show my kid passport all the time because they thought my 1,5 year old is too big for her age. Told me to deflate my flytot even tho other passengers in economy class are allowed to using theirs, even after I deflated it they keep coming back and woken me up because they thought I was still using it! I have to literally show them I didn't use the flytot anymore!  Again I will never fly with China airlines ever again. The only reason I gave 2 stars for cabin service and not 1 star is because one of the flight attendant actually felt bad for keep asking me about my child.

✅ Trip Verified |  China Airlines has the worst customer service and support. We booked a round trip from Singapore to Vancouver last week. Our flight got cancelled due to a typhoon in Taipei and we got to know of it just a day before we were suppose to fly. There was no way to reach out to the airlines - no helpline 24*7. It was a struggle to contact the airline and we wrote on their Facebook page on which they responded. They asked to wait and asked to visit the airport next day morning. Got there early morning and they blatantly said they can’t do anything! Flight is cancelled and no replacement to fly. We were told there is one flight which was on very short notice and we coudnt have possibly taken it! With no way out we booked another flight to do our trip paying a lot more extra. We reached Vancouver and were continuously getting messages from China Airlines for our return flight which made us comfortable that our outgoing flight is on! To our horror, we were stopped from boarding the flight! And then came in the China Airlines supervisor who broke some news to us which none bothered to convey till then by the airlines. First he said if you board the flight you can’t get refund for the incoming flight which we technically did use. Yes, we couldn't use because you cancelled the flight and did not give any backup flight to the helpless customer. None of the customer service people at the airport told us about the refund and cancellation in such scenarios. Zero communication. The supervisor blatantly asked to decide whether to board and forget the refund for one way or buy another ticket and take a full refund. We were aghast. This isn’t just a monetary situation but a big mental pressure for someone travelling with family. The airline showed no sympathy towards the child too. To convey the same we went to one of the representatives and they kinda looked lost had no idea and then directed us to someone else, laughing at out back. This is ridiculous and shows the airline lacks basic human courtesy! A little later the supervisor came and said That we can't board the flight altogether! Since the ticket stands null and void! None from the airlines conveyed us till now and instead we were getting all flight updates on messages. Is it a technical problem that your system shows customer wrong information and you the right information? We coudnt sleep looking for another pocket friendly Flight to go Home and hotel to stay. Who’s to be blamed? We may forget the financial loss but the mental agony China Airlines has caused is beyond words.;"""lacks basic human courtesy""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Brisbane via Taipei. Extremely good experience! Firstly terrific value for money as this similar trip with Turkish Airlines or Singapore Airlines was going to cost over double the price of China Airlines! Ground staff were helpful and efficient, lounge in Taipei was great and cabin crew service was friendly yet not overbearing. The food on all sectors was terrific with plenty of variety in the meals across all 4 sectors - I always chose to eat rather than sleep since I didn't want to miss the meal! Seats are very comfortable and happily got all the sleep I could. Both the B777 and A350 were enjoyable although the A350 is the newer and better product. I was worried about my bags as I also had a flight before Frankfurt but both bags happily made it through all 6 flights without being lost or damaged. Only negatives are that the entertainment system is a bit limited with about 50% of the movies in English with few of them particularly recent and the selection is poorly organised, especially compared to someone like Emirates, but in Business Class it was easy to sleep rather than watch a movie - this would be a bigger problem in Economy where it's harder to get good sleep. Also their flight schedule can lead to some long transit layovers in Taipei and they make too many announcements in the lounge, which was especially unnecessary when a small delay of 20 minutes on my flight was communicated to me via text, email and a lounge attendant even came and found me personally to let me know! So many announcements affected the atmosphere a bit and made it hard to rest. Definitely recommended with a terrific value for money in Business Class and a great product and service.;"""terrific value for money""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I booked round-trip flight from LAX to Bangkok via Taipei for January 2020. Since the time I booked the flight 5 months ago, the flight times were changed at least 5 times. The latest arrival time is much later than the original arrival time which created a problem for my plans. I cancelled the fight but was charged $200 cancellation fee ($100 for each person in the booking). Since my cancellation was due to China Airline’s change of schedule, the $200 cancellation fee should be waived. But China Airline refused to refund. ;"""flight times changed at least 5 times""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Denpasar to Rome via Taipei. The first leg on our return journey (DPS-TPE) was by an old 747- 400: the aircraft was pretty rundown, with a bad smell and very narrow seats; the old IFE didn't work properly and FA tried to reboot the system multiple times but my personal screen didn't work properly. Food average. The second leg (TPE-FCO) was a different story: the A350 is a great plane : plenty of space, great IFE and I could stretch my legs and sleep almost the whole flight, wonderful mood lights and smiling FA made this 13 hours journey very pleasant.";"""A350 is a great plane""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Bangkok via Taipei return. All 4 flights  were nothing short of exemplary, operated by an A350, which is much quieter and noticeably reduces jet lag. The crew on all my flights were friendly, professional and very safety conscious. Meal service was prompt and with a smile, and the crew were polite and friendly. I ordered several drinks and requested a toothbrush and an adapter and all were delivered quickly. They passed out hot towels for economy class passengers which is a much-appreciated gesture. During the overnight flight staff often passed through the cabin with water and juice, and kept the toilets clean. My flight back to Melbourne was delayed by 8 hours and we were provided accommodation at the Novotel near Taipei airport and they organised a shuttle bus to take us back to the airport in the morning, I found the ground staff at Taipei airport to be friendly and customer focused. The onboard entertainment system is easy to navigate and had many new releases and TV shows to choose from. The only aspect that could be improved is their food options, I found most of my meals to be lacking flavor, however they did offer an ice cream bar and a bread roll with all meals. Staff offer a selection of juice soft drinks, wine and coffee/Chinese tea with the meal service. I would not hesitate to fly with them again, in fact I found their service to be superior to Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines and would recommend China Airlines without hesitation.;"""would recommend China Airlines""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. Relatively new A350 with comfortable seats and nice 11"" IFE screen with USB and power outlet. The back seat design lacks enough forethought in not making available slots for tablets and mobile phones and a hook for small items to hang. Having said that there is good legroom space. The entertainment choice is still limited. The flight crew service was better than the ICN-TPE leg but they lack the courteousness that other Asian airlines are known for. One example, one flight attendant told a passenger to bring the seat back upright for a meal. She was quite rude and abrupt. For a Chinese her manner would have been viewed as a typical request, but as a flight attendant serving passengers of various nationalities, that would not be acceptable. She looked as if she was one of the more senior member of the flight crew. The food was still below average and the flight attendants were once again rushing through the meal service offering coffee and tea even though passengers had not finished the main meal. Overall, they lack the expected attention to detail and professionalism to compete effectively with other airlines. The excellent hardware, ie. the plane, is let down by the subpar flight crew service.";"""there is good legroom space""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Seoul Incheon to Taipei. The flight crew lacks the polish and professionalism of some airlines. The meal service was rushed with coffee and tea being offered even before most could finish the meal and in a rushed manner that if you were not paying attention you would have missed them. The IFE is an old outdated 6.5"" touch screen that is due for an update with relatively limited choice of entertainment. The pillows and blankets were not separately packaged raising questions of possible sanitation. The food quality is below average. One thing that is going for China Airlines is their fare which tends to be cheaper than others.";"""lacks polish and professionalism""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Vancouver via Taipei. My overall experience is okay. Needs further improvement on the audio. Also, the food should be improved, aesthetically and by flavor. Our taste buds aren’t much functional when in high altitude, so it is a must that aroma and flavor of the food compliments each other, or else, all of the food will just taste all pretty much the same. I had a bad experience in my baggage when the ground steward in Manila told me that my baggage will go straight to Saskatoon (my final destination), and not to be picked up in Vancouver. Since I was a new flyer, I didn’t know much of this. I even clarified (twice) with the steward if I will be picking it up in Saskatoon or Vancouver, and he kept on saying that it’s gonna be in Saskatoon. But when I arrived in Saskatoon, my baggage wasn’t there. So much inconvenience on my part. They need to have well-trained and knowledgeable staff when it comes to these types of situation, or a mentor should be around in this case. With this, I don’t know if I will fly with China Airlines anymore.;"""bad experience in my baggage""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Osaka via Taipei, returning from Sapporo. Overall China Airlines offers a decent Business Class at a reasonable fare. Both check-in processes were efficient and friendly. The lounges in Melbourne, Taipei and Sapporo were comfortable without being luxurious - good spaces to relax, with pleasant food and drink options. On board, the seats turned into nice lie-flat beds, the main downside being a lack of storage space around the seats. The crews were hardworking, polite and generally friendly. Only soft drinks were offered as a welcome, but there was a reasonable wine and spirits list. My vegetarian meals were fine but not adventurous. No amenities kits were provided, and there were no toothbrushes/paste provided in the toilets -- a sign of some cutting of corners in this product. Three flights operated punctually, one was delayed 30 minutes due to ""ground handling issues"".

✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Taipei. Originally I was booked on EVA Air, but about a week before my flight in late June 2019 they went on strike with a number of flights cancelled and I was changed to this flight about a week before my departure. EVA operates an A330 with 2-2-2 in business class on this route but China Airlines operates an A350-900 with a 1-2-1 and what a stunning cabin this is probably the nicest business class cabin I have travelled. With a late departure around 2250 from Brisbane and an arrival into Taipei at 0545 the next morning with just under 9 hours in the air the quick meal service on departure was well organized and excellent quality which left a reasonable amount of time for some sleep before breakfast before arrival in Taipei. The seat on this plane is fantastic with plenty of storage a great screen and a very sturdy table that pulls out from under the screen and always have a little part exposed so is always a handy shelf at anytime. The finishes that they have used seem to be of a really high quality with my 16 month old plane looking like it was on its first flight. No pyjamas are provided but slippers and a nice amenity kit are. ;"""nicest business class cabin""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. The walking aisle was no bigger than for 1 person (like planes in short flights), therefore it was not possible to stretch your legs, and in the flight London - Sydney you really need it. I would not recommend this company for more than 4 hr flight max. The food was very boring, pretty much all the same - rice with something. I was woken up by staff in the middle of the flight and ask to move to my original seat even I was already there, I showed my ticked, however the staff didn't apologise me. Very upsetting when it is very hard to fall in sleep in the very uncomfortable flight, but instead of enjoying it you been woken up. ;"""food was very boring""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Overall an excellent Business Class product on the A350, the seat offers privacy and comfort with an easy to operate inflight entertainment system.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Taipei. I had an extremely bad experience with China Airlines, and request some answers from them. We bought tickets mid February for return tickets : Hong Kong – Taiwan (flight CI 922). At check-in, the morning of the flight, the staff simply told us that we couldn’t take our flight. Besides generating a huge frustration feeling before our holidays even start, the fact that she didn’t propose any solution or even look for solution is simply astonishing. So the reason she gave us is that our names on the booking didn’t match our passports. To be precise, our First Name was correct, and our Family Name was also correct. BUT, she told me that we had to put all our middle names as well with our First Names. Apparently, this is a change in the policy that was pushed before, but she was not able to tell us how recently. And as we did not put our middle names, our tickets were unusable, we couldn’t take the plane. Everything else was correct : passport number, dates, etc. No solution proposed, no real help, nothing… Oh wait, actually yes, she proposed us a solution : buy new tickets, obviously ! In my country, the middle names are absolutely never used. Moreover, every time I didn’t put our middle names in the booking, all the companies let us go on the plane. But China Airlines only decided not to. So I tried to find a solution, any action we could do to amend it. Of course, modifying the booking online by myself was prohibited by China Airlines website. I went back on the website to check the display of the booking page, and where this rule is written. So actually there is now a mention in brackets to put middle names (which I don’t remember to see last time, anyway). However, there are only 2 boxes called “Last Name” and “First Name”. If you require middle names too, add a dedicated box, it is clearer. On top of that, my first name contains an hyphen, but the website does not accept it. Moreover, I have commas between my middle names, but as the website does not accept special characters neither, how to input them ? Finally, where there is a change in policy, you should make it more obvious ! The technical limitations of the website make everything even more confusing. So at the counter I asked her to amend our booking; not possible neither. How come ?? Wait, actually, yes, she could modify the booking, but ONLY 3 LETTERS… What ? yes, 3 letters. So she managed to amend our son’s booking as the middle name was only 3 letters long (of course, with a fee), but not ours… What of a rule is this ? So actually, China Airlines CAN amend booking. Technically and regulatory, it is possible(I presume China airlines will use some kind of dark regulation to explain that only 3 letters can be changed for security purposes…) They just didn’t for us. So we finally bought new tickets, with fees, more expensive of course. I made reimbursement request for the old ones, and of course, no answer yet. And I don’t expect any. Better have customers paying twice and not losing money, right China airlines ? At Taipei counter, I told China Airlines staff my story, and ask them if they could amend our names, they replied “yes it should be possible to amend”, “hum, I don’t understand why they told you that in Hong Kong, I am not sure why”.";"""extremely bad experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Awful customer service! I purchased a 2-segments tickets through China Airline website. The 2nd segment (New York to Boston) was carried by JetBlue. When I contacted China Airlines to get refund for the 2nd segment, they told me that JetBlue did something to the ticket so they can't process the ticket in their system right now. I asked China Airlines to talk directly to JetBlue, but they wouldn't do it. They kept asking me to translate their issues for them although I don't even know some of the terminology used. And each time when I called back to China Airlines, I got connected to a different rep so I had to repeat my story and tell the 2nd rep about what the first rep told me and what JetBlue told me. These went on for 4 rounds. Each round, I had to explain more, why there need to be a refund, what the 1st rep said, what JetBlue replied, what the 2nd rep said, etc. It is an unbelievably bad customer service. Finally, somehow they were able to process it and told me they'd contact me about the refund. Few days later, I got an email from China airline telling me that yes, they could refund me now, but I'll need to personally go to a China Airlines office, which is in a completely different state, far from the state I live to get this refund! I was very furious and replied by asking who would pay the airfare for me to fly to another state to get this refund in person and why couldn't they simply refund the money back to the credit card I used to purchased the tickets in the first place. At this moment, I have not gotten any reply about my email and have not seen the money deposited to my credit card either.;"""Awful customer service""";"

Not Verified |  San Francisco to Bangkok via Taipei. The seats on their 777-300 and A350 are excellent, wide and full lie-flat, and decent blanket. The seats are sturdy, so you can't feel movement by other passengers in neighboring seats getting up and down. Amenities are decent, and the cabin staff is attentive. Overall, though, this is at best a middling business-class product. Unlike other airlines, you don't get Champagne before departure, just a choice of apple juice, orange juice, or water. In-flight entertainment options are quite limited, with many movies and TV shows available only in Chinese. The food tends to be merely edible, and seldom appetizing or enjoyable. It's beyond me why they charge business class passengers for WiFi - there's nothing like paying upwards of $5000 for a single ticket, trying to log on to WiFi, and finding that you need to pay extra for WiFi access. As for ground service, China Airlines lounges are notoriously bleak. They're often quite crowded, and the food and beverage choices are ridiculously limited. (In Taipei, for example, they have 4-5 dim sum varieties on offer, some congee, and a couple of other Chinese offerings, such as a cabbage stir-fry dish. At the SFO lounge, the choices are vastly more limited. You'll get far better food outside in the terminal.) The functionality of the China Airlines website is primitive at best - I have yet to find out how to pull up my itinerary without trying to check in.;"""lounges are notoriously bleak""";"

They were so attentive and despite being Taiwanese, their Japanese language skills were superb. TPE-KUL-TPE was just heaven. The decor on the B777-300ER was well thought out. The flight attendant on the KUL-TPE leg went beyond the norm of a normal FA. When I asked the brand of the Oolong tea served on the aircraft, she gladly gave me a tea bag of the one they serve on flight.

✅ Trip Verified |  Vienna to Palau via Taipei. It was an excellent experience. The service was consistent and cordial on all 4 legs of the trip. I find the business class seat very comfortable on the A350. The old school seat on the 737 is comfortable enough for the shorter flights. On my way back flying Palau to Taipeh I was the only passenger in C and the flight attendant did everything to keep my glass filled.  Food was good and plenty, the entertainment was good with many choices. I tested the onboard WLan which was alright, but not really needed. The lounge in Taipeh was comfortable and the shower highly appreciated. On my final leg to Vienna a (minor) medical incident occured and they looked for medical personnel. Me and another MD attended the passenger. Afterwards the purser came personally to thank me and bowed to me. I felt very special being a customer of this airline!;"""an excellent experience"" ";"

✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Manila via Taipei.  All 4 segments of our flights went relatively well, there were no hassles and the fare we paid was good especially since this was for Christmas peak season. The San Francisco-Taipei and Taipei-San Francisco flights both were excellent but the Taipei-Manila and Manila-Taipei were okay. SFO-TPE: Check-in was a breeze and there were no hassles with the luggage although we were slightly overweight by a fraction. The B777-300ER plane we flew looks fairly new. We got seats 71H & 71K - perfect for couples. Food was good, service was decent. There were lots of entertainment options, movies, etc. and monitor was huge and resolution was sharp. Toilet was clean and I was told flight crew periodically clean it/wipe it down, which was well appreciated. They exceeded my expectations. TPE-MNL: We had 1.5 hours of transit time but lines were very long through security. Aircraft was A330 with a 2-4-2 configuration. We loved the fact that we were seated on a pair of seats as we like to keep to ourselves. Service was decent, nothing exceptional. Food was okay. There were some entertainment options on board including movies but since this was a 2-hour flight, it was not enough to finish a complete movie. The aircraft was also older and the monitor was smaller and not as sharp than the B777-300ER. MNL-TPE: Same aircraft as TPE-MNL with similar experience. My only unfavorable comment was that restrooms weren't clean on this flight. Some passenger completely made a mess in the entire lavatory and it appears flight crew do not clean this, possibly because it was a very short flight. TPE-SFO: Similar comments as CI003 SFO-TPE. We were seated on 70H & 70K. We really loved the pair of seats in the back. Again, food and service were excellent. No transit issues as we purposely took the 11-hour layover to see the city. However, immigration line took 1.5 hours - not good. Otherwise, the experience was good. Overall we were very pleased with our experience. Flights were on time, products and services were good, luggage came as expected and there were no significant inconveniences/hassles. We would consider flying China Airlines again.;"""consider China Airlines again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Los Angeles connecting at Taipei, with Special Assistance of Wheel chair for me. After alighting from CI 832 at Taipei around 7:00 pm, I was asked to ride a fully packed cab with similar assisted passengers to the Transfer Area. I had a carry-on trolley bag with me, which personnel carelessly loaded on top of three folded wheelchairs. As the cab speeded on way my bag fell off the cab hitting the airport floor. I did complain to the accompanying staff and expressed my apprehension of the damage to its contents, and also showed them the visible external damage to the bag. Upon arriving at home in Anaheim, on opening the bag I found more than three pieces of the souvenirs had broken, as well as the bag had cracked. Not only I feel dismayed and heartbroken as the souvenirs are irreplaceable here, and the bag was almost new. Because of their fragility I had decided to hand carry the souvenirs instead of checking them as checked baggage. This is all due to sheer negligence of airport staff at Taipei.;"""negligence of airport staff""";"

About half an hour after departure, dinner was served - I went for the pork selection which came with a lot of side dishes. Very filling and delicious! Early the next morning we were served breakfast; I chose an omelette which came with fruit and yoghurt. The breakfast was tasty, though not as good as dinner. Arrival in Sydney was slightly early thanks to a strong tailwind, so we had to wait about ten minutes for our gate to be vacated by another aircraft. The legroom in economy was generous. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful, and were quite fluent in English.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew Sydney to San Francisco via Taipei. Both flights were great; cabin crew, service, food, seat design, usability, and comfort (almost as good as SIA's business class seat and better than Lufthansa's or United), cleanliness, and punctuality (both flights left on time and arrived early) were spot on. As a bonus, clearing immigration at SFO, reclaiming our bags, and getting our hire-car were painless. Touchdown at 17:47, on our way at 19:15. The same process took us well over 3 hours a few years ago. They lost points for the wi-fi (too unreliable to be of any use) and the Sydney and Taipei lounges (reasonable, but more functional than welcoming with okay but not great food). Overall almost as good as you could want and extremely good value compared to Qantas and United Airlines direct SYD/SFO flights, though it does take longer obviously.

✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Fukuoka via Taipei. I booked China airlines as they were quite cheap. Check in was quick for the flight from Bangkok to Taipei, and this flight was 25% full, so everyone spread out and was comfortably seated. Boarding was smooth. I changed to an exit row after the doors closed, so no complaints on legroom. Seats were quite plush. This was a newer A330 and the seat had a touchscreen TV, USB charging point and a shared power outlet. Food on most of the flights were of good quality, although I went for the less appealing option half the time! The flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Service was relatively quick. On the flight to Fukuoka, we had a 45 minute connection, and walking distances can be quite long through Taipei Airport, so we were some of the last passengers to board. This flight used a 737 Sky Interior, which I must say has the worst bathroom.  This aircraft did not come with personal TVs but it's understandable as the flight lasted less than two hours. On the return flight, I flew from Osaka on their 777-300ER. On this flight, Premium economy was sold as standard economy, so I jumped at the opportunity and managed to get front-row seats for me and my mum. The premium economy seats look fantastic, have plenty of privacy, but I wouldn't choose them for a long haul transpacific flight. This is as the recline isn't too plenty and the hard backrest itself is a bit impractical.  On flights to Japan, I highly recommend their Sapporo beer. It's the best can of beer I've had in the sky! On the flight to Bangkok, it was an older A330 this time and didn't feature power outlets or usb ports, and the seat recline was broken on many seats, so it would recline or not stay reclined at some points on the flight. To sum up, China Airlines isn't a bad choice.;"""they were quite cheap""";"

However, the plane on Taipei-Delhi route was old and the seats were not that comfortable. Moreover, the lounge at Taipei was undergoing some renovations and there was a notice to contact ground staff for a voucher. The ground staff was not available in that part of the terminal and showed up 45 minutes before departure. On both my inbound and outbound travels, they had no idea about any such offer nor did they offer anything or apologize for not being able to provide lounge to business class traveler. For that reason alone, I will avoid traveling with China Airlines again.;"""avoid traveling China Airlines again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Auckland. Our flight was supposed to depart at 1pm. We sat on the plane until 2:30pm with absolutely no information or notification that the flight was delayed. Once they finally decided to announce the delay, we were told it would be another 2 hours minimum as “the plane needed to be inspected.” We were not allowed to get off the plane and no reimbursement was offered. So we are sitting in the plane 3 hours after “scheduled departure time” with 0 notice, reimbursement or options. Because the flight was delayed so long, by the time we arrived in Auckland it was too late to check into our accommodation, which was $198 wasted. When we brought this up to the staff they act like they have no idea how such a thing could happen.

✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Taipei. After a pleasant flight, this was the worst arrival I have experienced after millions of miles of travel. The flight arrived at the terminal just a few minutes late. There had been the usual pre-landing announcements but these were totally inaudible as the purser clearly had never checked the volume. Deplaning there was one China Airlines employee at the gate with a sign directing onward passengers to Fukuoka. This was gate D2 at the end of the terminal, and so it was a long walk to get to Immigration at the other end. Since I have a frequent visitors pass it took less than a minute to get through the formalities and I expected to get my bag and be on the way to my hotel within 30 minutes at most and just missing the start of the evening rush hour traffic. The wait for bags from BKK was interminable. I know Taoyuan can be busy, but after 40 minutes I had had enough. I walked the length of the baggage hall to the CI office. There I was told I was in the wrong terminal! This was totally unbelievable! I then had to walk upstairs, reverse the Immigration process and somehow find the route to Terminal 1. Once there, I was told the Immigration officer at Terminal 2 after voiding my arrival stamp should have returned my entry form which he failed to do. So there was a lot of phoning after which another form had to be completed. By the time I finally got to the the baggage hall, the carousel had stopped and my bag was the only one there. This whole nonsensical process had taken 90 minutes by which time I should have been in my hotel room. The Immigration staff at Taoyuan were efficient and only doing their duty. But for CI to have a flight arrive at the wrong terminal and then fail to ensure that every departing passenger was perfectly aware not only that they had to proceed to a different terminal but that each was directed very clearly to that terminal is an absolute disgrace. I will stick with TG and Eva for this route in future.;"""an absolute disgrace""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Ontario. They started the pre-landing safety check 7 minutes prior to the arrival time. No one checked the entire row of overhead bin above. The cabin crew finally finished the random safety check 2 minutes prior to landing. It was a long haul flight so I don't get why they pushed it to the last couple minutes and did it so rushed and irresponsible. I am thinking about flying with Eva air next time. At least Eva pays a lot more attention to safety issues.;"""so rushed and irresponsible""";"

Ontario to Taipei. China Airlines has a lot to improve. The boarding is the slowest I've ever seen. They just kept pausing the boarding. The cabin looks super nice on its official website yet it was actually not as impressive or comfortable. The seat was the crampest I've ever seen on a long haul flight, I kept moving my back cause it was really uncomfortable. The yellow blanket looks super used. As for the food, again, the worst I've ever seen on a long haul flight. Often I don't expect any nice meal on a coach class, but China Airlines really went too far. You don't even get a dessert like cake, only two side dishes. And the salad was a mess. You should not expect much for the snack in between the meals when flying economy class as well, but saltine crackers, what a joke. The restroom was kind of dirty. EVA, ANA, or Asiana all kept their restroom clean so I don't get why can't China Airlines keeps it at least not dirty. The service was okay, they are neither attentive nor rude. One last thing, just when we arrived at 5, I waited for my checked luggage till 6:30. The bottom line is you China airlines really has a lot to improve.;"""really has a lot to improve""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Amsterdam via Taipei. Don't fly this airline from Australia / North America through Taipei to Europe. Booked a Premium Economy flight from SYD to AMS for a personal trip. Premium Economy looked very good on their A350s. Only a week after booking they cancelled the SYD to TPE flight on the way out which when challenged, they suggested leaving earlier and having an 18 hour stop in TPE. I got them to book me a hotel, some meals and as the hotel was only for 12 hours, business class lounge access for the final wait, which took a fair bit of persuasion. Then a month before departure they cancelled the return TPE to SYD leg and caused me to stay yet again another 18 hours in TPE. At this point I had had enough but was too close to departure to try and find another Prem Econ ticket anywhere near the price. I tried to persuade them to upgrade me to Business so I could sleep properly, as I was now arriving on a workday and had to go straight to work. They just refused, even though the ticket price difference was 550 Euros, if I was to compare a fresh single ticket Business versus Economy. So they had to book the hotel and meals but this time refused point blank access to the Business Class lounge on the basis they don't run their own lounges in their main hub. Unfortunately, as a non-EU Carrier, they are only liable for delays on flights leaving the EU, so only 1 of the 2 delays was covered, although they are trying to ignore their responsibility at the moment. The planes are nice. The Premium Economy Seat is very big, and when you first sit down, with loads of leg room. However, to recline it, the seat goes forward - a lot! So much so that (and I am not tall, only 1.78m) you cannot fit your feet under the seat in front, so unless you are very short, the complete recline is useless. The food in Premium, unlike most other airlines, is pure Economy, and to be honest even more unappetizing than standard airline food. Their onboard service is questionable to say the least, even in Premium. For example, on 3 out of the 4 flights, they only produced a pre-dinner bar car once, and you had to keep asking for drinks, which might finally arrive. The inflight entertainment is pretty basic unless you are Chinese, luckily, I had a load of Netflix downloaded. All in all, I will never fly them again, and would suggest anyone tempted by decent pricing on tickets, particularly in premium classes, be very careful if flying long haul through Taipei (from Australasia, North America etc) - if the flights are not full, they will drop them and you will be stuck in TPE. Customer focussed - not on your life!;"""I will never fly them again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  New York JFK to Yangon via Taipei. I have flied so many times with different airlines from JFK to Yangon. But this is the worst experience ever. All my baggage are left at the transit. I can understand that that’s because of short transit hour and the airlines told me that’s normal for them. The problem is that I requested the wheel chair and no one picked me up at the transit. This is seriously ridiculous. I was awaiting the wheel chair until the last 5 minutes to the next airplane. This must be my last time taking China Airlines.;"""last time taking China Airlines""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Taipei. I had booked through KLM (who partner with China Airlines) and I had trouble to access my booking via China Airlines and therefore could not select my seat, which I found rather disappointing. This shouldn't be difficult to get right. The flight itself was very good. A  new plane with comfortable seats. Good leg space. Very attentive cabin crew. A lot of choice of movies and TV in the entertainment system. The food was good, although there was no hot chocolate, in lieu of coffee. An overnight bag with blanket, toothbrush and slippers was provided (which unfortunately is not standard anymore on long haul flights). All in all I would fly with China Airlines again, although I hope they improve the booking and check in process.;"""would fly China Airlines again""";"

Not Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. It was a new A350 plane, with a herringbone business class seat arrangement, meaning that everyone had a private, yet aisle seat. Seats were excellent, fully flat with convenient pockets to store things and wider than some others. The table for meals or laptops etc was very stored under the TV screen, and deployed directly towards the passenger, rather than swivelling out, which is a great improvement on other business class table layouts. The slippers and personal vanity bag contain nothing worth taking off the plane. Service was somewhat functional rather than engaging but a lot of the crew had little English. They were kind and helpful but not very interactive. Food was okay and substantial, but not exceptional. China Airlines seem to be able to leave and arrive at airports on time. All in all a great business class outcome if you aren't fussed about the food and service but want a great seat and on time delivery. The Taipei lounge is good also. Comfortable seats and food and drink on tap and a kitchen doing Chinese dishes on demand.;""" Seats were excellent""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Gatwick. Really impressive service and comfort. I’m a tall person and still had plenty of leg room. The staff are friendly and helpful and attentive. If you are English speaking you may struggle a little as the airline is very Chinese focused. So language could be a problem. Not a big problem but have patience and humor. The airport at Tai[ei is fantastic. We were in transit both ways. The transit area is bright and spacious. For me and my wife, we had no problems. I’d happily go again, as soon as I’m over the jet lag. The food was excellent I must say.;"""friendly and helpful""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Taipei. I have flown this airline several times and normally had good service but my last flight was a disaster. We were scheduled to leave Vancouver at 2:20 am. After no notifications the flight was delayed for one hour. At 4 am we were told it was now delayed until 8 am. After trying to sleep for a few hours on benches or the floor at 8:30 we were told the flight was cancelled. This was just the beginning. After going through customs and immigration (we never left the country?) We got back to the checkin counters and formed an enormous queue of approximately 300. They had 3-4 ground staff to attempt to rebook all of us on other flights as they were not sure that the aircraft would be ready to fly the next morning. Complete chaos ensued. There was virtually no communication between CA staff and passengers. Finally around 5:50 pm the last of us were confirmed on flights the following day. They begrudgingly gave a few dozen passengers hotel rooms with no food allowance. I lost 2 days in Manila, my final destination and was not offered any compensation for my prepaid hotel room. Overall a terrible beginning to a trip.;"""last flight was a disaster""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. I was impressed with the comfort and service. The staff was very friendly, they were prompt with meal time and very accommodating. The take off and landing were quite smooth, and I was happy with how painless the boarding was. The food was pretty good, with enough in the meal to fill me up for hours. For economy class the seats were decently comfortable, and the leg room was more than I was expecting. I loved the touch screens and the quantity of movie choices. My overall experience was as comfortable and painless as a flight can be. I would recommend this airline to anyone looking to take a lengthy flight.;"""comfortable and painless""";"

Not Verified |  Christchurch to Auckland. Have previously flown with this airline in Business Class and could not fault it. We flew Premium Economy this time and were very disappointed. The seats are very comfortable and lots of movies to choose from, but the food and service were average. We had flown from Brisbane to Auckland three days earlier and were fed Fried Rice - no other choice(s) that was it! Coming back it was chicken with mushrooms, rice and vegetables. It was OK, but under seasoned and very bland. My husband cannot eat mushrooms and he eats hardly any vegetables. When he advised the hostess of this she came back with a serve of garlic bread from Business Class. That was his meal! He has a healthy appetite and was not impressed. I would point out that the same meals were being service to Economy Class, so not effort made to provide something a little bit better in Premium Economy. Drinks service limited - one with your meal, and another one just after. That was it. I do not think they were ever offering spirits. They also did not come round offering water on a regular basis, as most airlines. Will definitely go Business Class next time - I do recommend that.;"""food and service average""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Taipei. One of the worst experiences I have had boarding a gate. Prior to boarding the gate I was hassled over my returning ticket which I did have. The boarding staff of China airlines were terrible they were forcing me to purchase another ticket. On top of that I am being told they will not allow me to board the gate, they will close the gate on me and that I would be sent home. I was forced to purchase a ticket that I will not use and cannot be refunded on now. All of my friends who flew out to Bali did not have any of these issues or forced to purchase a ticket going home.

✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. Flight was originally on the 10th to London but rescheduled for the 11th because of a tropical storm heading towards Japan/Taiwan. I was upset because I was going to now miss the Semi final match between England and Croatia. I gave China airlines a ring was on hold for an hour (at this point I was ready to give up) and then was told at 10:15am that if I get to Sydney airport by 11am they would get me on an earlier flight and reach Taiwan before the storm does. So jumped in an Uber and was 5mins late. Thankfully I was put on an earlier flight as soon as I arrived! ;"""put on an earlier flight""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Denpasar. After a substandard flight from LHR to Taipei via Amsterdam, I was transferred to Bali. The transfer process in Taipei airport isn’t as easy as other major hubs as it involved a lot of stairs and lifts and a very confusing layout. The CI lounge in T1 was very crowded and it didn’t feel like a hub lounge for a major airlines, and when the main lounge was crowded they sent passengers to a small lounge which felt like a classroom. Outward journey: we left Taipei ontime. Boarding was easy and smooth. To my disappointment it was an old A330 with very dated interior. The seating was comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Entertainment was again very dated. Unlike my experience with their long haul flight, shortfall flights with China Airlines seem to be a different class. All the crew members on this flight was very friendly and approachable, and they didn’t stop providing any food or drink throughout the flight. It was indeed one of the best flights I had in terms of services. Landed in Bali on time but it was a long wait for the luggage. Return journey: check in at Bali was very slow but the agents were all very friendly. Returning flight was a slightly newer plan (A330). Service was again better than most of the long haul flight but definitely not as good as the outbound journey. Arrival at Taipei was very efficient. Quick immigration check and luggage was out within few minutes.;"""Entertainment was very dated""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  OK service, issue with the planes I travelled London Heathrow to Taipei (with onward journey to Bali) in June with China Airlines. It involved a stop over at Amsterdam and the flight between London and Amsterdam was on KLM, while AMS to TPE was on China Airlines. Outbound flight left Amsterdam on time and arrived at Taipei few minutes ahead of schedule. China Airlines use new A350 for its European routes with the exception of Frankfurt. Once I got onboard I immediately noticed that the seat control panel wasn’t working. As a result there were only three possible positions throughout the flight – sit up, relax or flat bed. The table lamp was also disable because of this. I reported to the crew but they didn’t do anything until almost landing. Service was pretty efficient but not particularly warm nor friendly. Returning lag was slightly better. The CI lounge in Taipei terminal 1 was very dark and crowded until late evening. It was renovated 2-3 years ago but has started to show some sign of poor maintenance. The food and drink provided is substandard. Boarding was late by circa 20 minutes but the process was very easy for business class passengers. I was greeted by name by the cabin manager and the team which doesn’t always happen on CI long haul flights. Some of the crew members on this flight were exceptional. However I experienced problem again with the hardware. One of the toilets was out of order which means there was only one toilet for the business class cabin; the window shed in seat 14K was also broken. Seems to me that CI has a lot of maintenance issues. Overall it was a typical China Airlines long haul flight I’d expected. Nothing special and definitely not as good as it main competitor EVA. However the flight time suits me better (as EVA quite often involves a stop over at Bangkok).";"""not as good as EVA""

✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Beijing. They were just doing their job. Very few ground staffs were there to help with the boarding. The flight attendants made no greeting when boarding and very limited interaction during the entire flight. The guy sitting next to me did not straight the seat back when takeoff and landing yet no cabin crew paid attention to it. The meal was okay. I am not picky about flight meal at all. A flight attendant sat on the jump seat with her legs crossed and stared into space after meal service. Together, the service was below average regarding Asia's airline but I would fly with China Airlines again if the ticket goes really affordable.;"""service was below average""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. As a family of 2 adults and a 14month old traveling to the UK, a balance of comfort and budget was important and after extensive research, I decided to give China Airlines a try since they’ve opened a 1 stop route SYD - LGW on brand new A350’s with a design awarded business cabin. I’ve flown business to the UK before with Qantas and Malaysian Airlines. Pre flight was simple with online pre-selection of meals, seats and free WiFi offer available but no limo service. Business check in counter and express path for security meant quick transit to the SkyTeam lounge which wasn’t as nice as the Qantas lounge and limited food & bev options. Priority boarding was available and once on board, the choice of the China Airlines business product proved itself to be a good one. The cabin and lighting is excellent, the flat bed seats/suites are modeled on Qatar and are spacious & comfortable. With an evening departure, our son slept with my wife for most of the SYD - TPE leg. A large screen with IFE including Pepper Pig kept him amused for the short time he was awake. Only downside was some language barriers with several stewardesses & western food was below average. TPE airport transit was straight forward with a modern comfortable lounge, baby room and showers along with good Asian food available. TPE - LGW boarded quickly again with priority boarding for business but once on board, the service stood out as better than the prior leg, largely because the cabin staff all spoke better English. The rules are more relaxed on this airline so letting our son play with his toys in the footwell area of my seat when he was awake was a big plus (Qantas would not have allowed this for safety reasons I suspect). Qantas also insist on making your baby sleep with the baby seat belt attachment on which is awkward and unhelpful when he’s already asleep. The food was also better on this leg and Pol Roger 2006 vintage pink champagne was excellent! Overall, My wife and I felt the seat product is superior to Qantas’ new business product which we flew to Hawaii in Nov. the in-flight service & food is inferior but here’s what the compromise gets you and your family, business return to London for 2/3rds of the Qantas cost or most other premium airlines prices. I’m a gold frequent flyer with Qantas but if they can’t get closer in price, I’ll be flying with China Airlines again for the next UK visit.;"""be flying  China Airlines again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Gatwick as my return journey. After a below expectation outgoing flight, the inbound flight was improved. Check in was smooth at a business class only counter. However the CI staff at the information desk was very rude to passengers making enquirers. Not a best representation of the company. It was very disappointing that as a business class passenger there is no dedicated lane for security and immigration. Security queue for both T1 (China Airlines) and T2 (EVA and China) tend to be long and neither airlines have special facilities for their business class passengers. The lounge in Taipei T1 (CI Dynasty lounge, the one closer to Gate A) was ok. It has no window but the design was classic. Food and drink choices were lacking. Boarding was announced in the lounge and there was a business class only bridge so you can skip the queue even if you are late at the gate. Service on this sector was significantly improved. I was offerred food and wine menu and was told that I should be able to change my food choice if I wanted to (I had pre-ordered online). The cabin manager introduced herself and offered a warm welcome. Again attention to details/amenities/food and drink were not as great as its main competitor EVA but this is partly compensated by the brand new airplane. Despite not offering full duvet and turn down service, sleep quality was good. The entertainment system also worked well. I personally found the onboard lounge on A350 a waste of space. I was told by the cabin manager that the lounge on 777 was larger and served its purpose and unfortunately it is not the case on A350. Business class passengers also only have 1 toilet (there are actually 2 but the other is frequented by passengers on deluxe economy). Overall the flight was a easy ride and we arrived at Gatwick early despite a late departure. It is not an overwhelming experience but it did work.;"not an overwhelming experience""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Taipei. I haven't flown China Airlines for 20 years primarily due to their poor safety record in the 90s and also due to lack of network in Europe. After they launched direct flight to London I decided to take the opportunity and fly  back to Taiwan for lunar new year. I booked it through online travel agent and it was easy. However China Airlines website is difficult to navigate. Menu pre selection is not shown on your main profile, and entertainment was on another website. Nevertheless the online check in process was very easy. At London Gatwick the ground service is handled by a 3rd party company. They are very courteous and friendly. The lounge was No. 1 at the South Terminal. Nothing fancy but did it work. Boarding was well organised as business passengers were invited to take a seat near the bridge. The flight in the business class section was empty. 8 passengers occupied the entire 32 seats. Immediate reaction was the airplane was spotless and clean, while service was lacking. They only offered soft drinks before take off. It was noticeable how quiet the A350 was - far better than 777 and it was very spacious. The entertainment was good - large screen, good choices of movie and a lot of interaction function. The seat was  comfortable. What fell short (well, when being compared with EVA which is its main competitors) is the ambition to deliver a full service. On EVA you have great amenity, pajama, great selection of wines and food and service was second to none. On China Airlines it feels they are just doing their job without going extra mile. The biggest disappointment is the layout of the A350. There are 32 seats but there is only 1 toilet in the front of the airplane plus one at the rear of the business class section which is often visited by passengers in Premium Economy. Overall it's a ok flight but nothing really stands out. If the price is right I will still fly with China Airlines as it saves few hours and I really like A350; otherwise I would prefer EVA Air or Cathay Pacific over China Airlines.";"""feels they are just doing their job""";"

However, it is always a painful experience, except the staff who is nice, the rest is really poor starting with the plane itself. It is a miserable plane with much too little space for a 5 hours international flight, this type of plane is usually used for domestic short flights only. Then there is no individual monitor and you have one poor movie playing for the all flight on a common screen.

✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Amsterdam via Taipei and was pleasantly surprised. Did not travel with check-in luggage so the only interaction I had with staff on the ground was at the gate. I checked in on-line and needed to get my boarding card printed. This was done promptly and I was directed to board the aircraft. Cabin in Business was clean, neat and looked well maintained. Cabin staff were very professional, used my name and ensured that I had all I required but were not intrusive. Sat in 12K on this leg of the journey, found the ambient temperature too hot, 180 degree flatbed was unfortunately wasted on this leg as couldn't sleep comfortably at that temperature. Arrived in Taipei with a 4hr wait, used the lounge which was comfortable and staff were pleasant, a few of them spoke English which helped. Used the shower facility which was clean. Boarded flight leg to AMS on time, flight left on time as did previous leg. Filled out my breakfast request, put my bed into flat position and fell asleep. Ambient temperature was lower and I slept really well, right through the dinner service. Was in seat 11A on this leg and was wondering to myself whether being in the second row from the front of the aircraft had any influence on the temperature. Seating starts at row 10 on China Airlines A350. When I woke up about 6hrs later, the staff were apologising for not serving me dinner, had to assure them that i was alright, they brought me biscuits and green tea. Several hours later after enjoying their In-Flight Entertainment, I was served my breakfast as ordered. Each and every interaction I had on these two legs were as one should expect of a business class cabin. Would probably fly them again if the same deal presented itself when I needed to travel.;"""was pleasantly surprised""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days). To get on that flight from Bahrain to London I have to pay a 200GBP 'change fee' and the difference in fare - for a flight that I have already paid for, and that I would have made.

Not Verified |  This is, by far, the best flight I have ever been on! I would give this way more than 10 if I could! Food: Meals, drinks, and snacks were absolutely delicious, especially the pizza, turkey sandwich, and more! Seating: We were in the aisle row (no windows, but it was still cool, because I had tons of legroom.) I loved how the seat and headrest reclined and how the tray was so big. Staff: Don't get me started! They were amazing. They attended to all our needs. Hot water? They got you. Lost headphones? They got you. Never seen a nicer staff. Entertainment: Did not exactly broaden to all my interests, but headphones were fully immersive. Amnesties: Oh my god, there's so many! Reclining seat. Bathroom lotion. Goodies bag with toothbrushing tools. The list is endless!;"""the best flight I have ever been on""";"

Not Verified |  This was the worst flight I have ever had. Poor customer service from start to end. I flew with Emirates from Gatwick to Dubai with my partner and 5 children. My 4 year old son is Autistic. Their level of service on board is awful, food was below standards. I kept on pressing the assistant bell and no one came over to assist me. I was only served drinks twice on a 7 hour flight. Toilets on board were disgusting. Seats are uncomfortable. I was expecting more from Emirates especially when travelling with a child with a disability.

✅ Trip Verified |  After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance. I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines. If you need wheelchair assistance at Dubai Airport, do not fly with Emirates.;"""appalling way I and others were treated""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We traveled with a group of 5, going to Karachi via Dubai was great as we were able to pay to upgrade to business class. On the return flight we were not able to pay for the upgrade option as there was no availability. From the check in counter at the Karachi airport to the transfer of the wheel chair passenger (with me) to the flight back to Houston the experience was horrible. The person working at the emirates counter in Karachi asking for a indirect bribe to the incompetent staff at the Dubai airport making us wait like a hour for wheel chair staff to transport us to the lounge as we waited for the connecting flight. When I asked to make sure we the wheel chair passengers are taken to the plaza lounge he asked how I had access I stated through Amex Business platinum. It was non of his business as an Emirates employee to ask to see my card for a lounge. The service on the plane was horrible.

✅ Trip Verified | I am astonished to read the number of negative reviews this airline receives. I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork. Maybe its the luck of the draw, but I personally think Emirates is tops.;"""have nothing but praise for their stellar product""";"

Not Verified |  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew. Absolutely appalling customer service. Every customer should think twice about using Emirates unless they are happy to be treated very unfairly when something does wrong.;"""handed a sleeping bag with no explanation""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  My partner and I requested wheelchair and assistance. He has his own electric wheelchair.

We got a few contradictory answers (and many employees’ nasty looks) and, after sitting on the luggage and floor por 40 minutes, because the request of a young couple that felt bad about my situation, the left a wheelchair at my side and no assistance. I am afraid of losing the flight and am still being ignored after about an hour and 15 min.  This company doesn’t have the most basic respect for the passengers! Economy class passengers are human beings too. I try to avoid wheelchairs but airports and the long walking distances with all the luggage are a challenge. They do not even start to check in economy before all business passengers are gone. They don’t even pretend to care! I don’t know if I am going to a developed country anymore. The introduction is not good. When I finally got assistance, the lady helping me was extremely nice (Mariluz).

We were held on the tarmac for almost an hour and a half with no explanation. Not surprisingly, we missed our flight. I went to the counter to get rebooked to a new one. It took 2 hours for the (extremely rude) customer service representative to offer me a flight 24 hours later and a motel (1/5 star review on Google). They insisted nothing else was available even though we were seeing tons of availability on our own. Furthermore, they told us we would get reimbursed for ubers and food during the 24 hours. I contacted Emirates several times and have had no such luck in getting reimbursed. They completely ignore you. Will never fly Emirates again despite the name brand. ;"""Incredibly poor experience""";"

Not Verified |  I can’t believe I’m writing this about Emirates since I’ve been flying with them for years but their customer service has gone down dramatically! I don’t know if it’s because they don’t pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardess’s are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They don’t want to do any hard work. Can’t even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I don’t know if they changed the catering? Total waste of my money and time. I should have flown Qatar Airways where you get your own cabin (with sliding door for privacy) and the air hostess are super kind and friendly. Only for $300 it’s totally worth it. Learned my lesson! Never again Emirates!;"""definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn't smile, weren't friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me ""this way, please,"" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn't offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it's not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn't be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times! I will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices. However, i do hope to see friendlier faces in future.";"""has been quite disappointing"" ";"

✅ Trip Verified |  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight. They say Emirates is a number 1 airline in the world and flying them is almost a privilege, but I disagree, Sorry.;"""the crew were nowhere to be seen""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Though Emirates only operates a handful of flights to and from Milan, it maintains a nice, spacious lounge with ample seating and good selections of food. I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent. However, I did encounter one of the nicest attendants in the sky.;"""Food was good in general""";"

Not Verified |  Do not trust them. Worst Airline and customer service. Purchased the ticket in full. Was issued E-ticket via email. Arrived to destination. On the return leg flight, was refused check in. Printed and presented at the check in. Upon presenting, the passenger was advised that the ticket is not valid and the seat that was booked in not available. Advised to purchase another ticket. When told that the ticket was all paid for and e-ticket was presented, they advised that they can’t do anything and advised to contact customer care. The check in closed and the flight departed. No money was returned. After contacting the customer service, advised to lodge an investigation. When asked what to do for the time being, they advised to purchase another ticket and deal with complaints department. Another ticket was purchased. Both customer service team and complaints department advised that they cannot do anything and to deal with the bank. When challenged the decisions, the both departments simply engorged communication. Ended up being double the money out of pocket and no explanation. Would never fly again with this shade company and will advise everyone to avoid as this can happen to anyone. Because the head office is overseas, no local governing agency have any power to challenge them. Be careful and stay away.;"""Worst Airline and customer service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that “it wasn't their fault”. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok.

✅ Trip Verified | This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out. ;"""not a very good experience""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or ""officer"")";"""worse than my already very low expectations""";"

You can lay on your back quite comfortably but I don't know how a bigger person will be comfortable especially on long haul flights. In each of the 4 legs at every meal time, the flight attendant asked me "" do you want to eat dinner/ lunch/ brunch?"". Of course I would. Where would I go for sustenance on a 15 hour flight? It's not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn't really a vegan meal. For a $5k ticket, I'd have hoped Emirates would've been a little creative and thoughtful with the vegan meal. ";"""Meal service was super slow""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai. The service on board was great. The touchscreen of the board entertainment system is on some planes are better than on others. The movie collection was vast but didn't fit my taste. My seat wasn't locked. So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern. They count the overweight as total. If family members check in individually, they could save a few bucks.;"""good value and great staff""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  EK135 22 October Seat 46A. This flight was a continuation of the Brisbane to Dubai flight 24 hours later. The flight was not full but paid and was given twin seats for myself and wife. Worth the extra cost as 3 rows of seats behind reserved for cabin crew who never used them on this flight. Took off on time arrived on time 2 meals served on flight and usual water and soft drinks tea and coffee. A good flight.;"""A good flight""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Dubai. Paid for seat selection and was given correct seat aisle 84c was fortunate there was empty middle seat on 14 hour flight. The Gluten Free meals which Emirates serve are excellent. The flight went smoothly and landed safely. Perhaps the only negative was water given with 2 meals and snack no cabin crew coming around with extra water between you seem to have to ask. Then stayed overnight at Dubai Airport Hotel before onward journey to Venice.;"""Gluten Free meals are excellent""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The service I expected from a low cost carrier, not one of the supposedly best airlines in the world. One of the check in ladies at Copenhagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure.;"""hasn't been a great experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2. The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didn’t serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didn’t exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasn’t impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle. All in all I think I would try another airline for this long journey next time, just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above.;"""think I would try another airline""";"

Not Verified |  Right from the airport I was facing an unpleasant experience. I was having a laptop bag and one hand baggage. The hand baggage was weighing exactly 7kg but he forced me to put both together and then put my baggage (there was no lock for it) into checked-in and had to pay for additional baggage. Then, while paying for it, they took my card and entered the card number when the payment is already done and machine has already generated receipt. Seems suspicious that my card number is needed to generate a receipt to my email for the additional baggage? Now money is gone and the baggage is damaged. The flight experience was not something great. Landing in Dubai had to wait forever for my baggage.;"""experience was not something great""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Johannesburg via Dubai. This must have been the worst booking experience and customer service of my life. My partner and I booked the exact same route at the exact same time from 2 different laptops directly from the Emirates website. Emirates confirmed they received his payment, the money was out of his account, but part of his flight is not yet confirmed. After a couple of attempts, they made some adjustments and sorted out the issue a few hours later. My booking could not process payment due to a pricing problem between the airlines. After numerous failed attempts over 3 days via customer service and live chats, failed rebooking attempts for the same route, and empty promises from customer agents calling me back, I finally just booked another date to ensure that we can at least spend Christmas together. NEVER in my life have I experienced any issues like this with Qatar (or any other airlines for that matter). Emirates advertise routes and when it comes to booking, they're not able to process and if they do process, they do a half-ass job which leaves customers feeling stressed and running around trying to finalize flight details. Avoid avoid avoid is all I can say. There is a reason Qatar airways is 5 star, and Emirates is 4 star.;"""worst booking experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Very impolite and rude cabin crew from ticketing counter to inside the plane. No just they don’t want help but also ignore you. And you try to catch the attention they literally yell and pass sarcastic comments. I was traveling with my 1 year old. They made our flight a horrible experience and on purpose they did not offer baby food in a 7 hour flight. All crew looked unhappy and were unpleasant to talk with mostly female crews. My flight from Dubai to Algeria was a nightmare because of crew negative behavior and lack of empathy for a mother who’s was traveling with a 1 year old.;"""Very impolite and rude cabin crew""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  It wasn’t a good experience at all. Young newly married couple who were clearly already pretty tipsy on boarding starting boozing hard as soon as it took off and kept a steady pace of drinking solidly for the entire 8hr flight. Cabin attendants kept giving them can after can even though they were getting very drunk. No consideration for others seated anywhere near them and it was really quite uncomfortable given the volume of their constant loud drunken chatter. After we landed at Dubai as I was standing in the aisle waiting on someone lifting something down from the overhead bins the male passenger staggered to his feet wobbled towards me and aggressively barked “where do you think you’re going eh?” Thankfully he was drunk enough I could sidestep him and leave him swaying around but come on Emirates you’re better than this. The cabin attendants should have stopped serving this pair long before landing as they were clearly intoxicated. Not good at all.;"""attendants should have stopped serving this pair""";"

Not Verified |  The first time travelling Emirates Business class and the last. They lost my luggage in Dubai and have now been without it for nearly 3 weeks. They have not contacted me once. I have phoned 3 times and have been promised $50 per day compensation, money back for all the clothes I have had to buy and calls back to advise on the progress of tracing my lost luggage. When I ask about how I claim this compensation they refuse to answer. They also refuse to answer timelines for tracing my luggage. They have been utterly useless and disinterested. I have called them, used Twitter and Facebook and they have delivered only generic responses. I have lodged two complaints through their complaints portal. No response.

✅ Trip Verified |  Firstly, canceled flights departing Athens to Perth leaving us stranded in Athens for a night so we had to get accomodation. Then you had my booked with a 14 hour stop over in Dubai which is unacceptable. I requested this to be changed and it was to a later flight which worked better. I was reassured my partners flight had been linked (we had separate bookings) and that we were both on the new flight together (this was via virtual chat). We arrive at the airport to check in and even though he had received flight confirmation we were told he didn’t have tickets so we had to go get this sorted at the emirates desk. We’re both finally on the same flight only to be told we cannot be seated together on either of the flights even though we booked months ago and had already selected our seats together. The man at Athens airport checking us in did not care or try to assist us. Absolutely terrible experience and now my partner and I get to sit alone on an 11 hour flight. Completely unacceptable and very poor form from Emirates. I want a refund or some form of compensation for the hotel, meals in Athens whilst stranded and the stress of this whole situation. Completely ruined the end of our trip. I will never fly with them again.;"""Absolutely terrible experience""";"

Not Verified |  We arrived in good time to check in at Dubai only to find that my wife’s and 5 year old daughters seats had been changed to be apart on the flight. Previously we had been sent an automatic allocation of seats 2 days before the flight placing them together. Despite my pointing out that a 5 year old cannot travel unaccompanied, no one seemed to care and I had to insist that a manager at least be involved. We were then taken to the aircraft in the hope that some passengers might change seats. 20 minutes past with no good news whilst we were just left to stand by the aircraft door. At no point was any offer made regarding accommodation or alternate flight and, again, we were encouraged to accept that our daughter would have to travel next to a random stranger and presumably feed herself hot meals throughout the 7 hour flight. And then as the doors were about to be shut 2 seats together were suddenly found! When I complained formally about the distress this all caused, a curt reply was sent denying that seats had been changed at check in. My view of this airline feels irreparable damaged and I simply wouldn’t trust them with providing a reliable and safe journey in the future when they cannot even look properly at what went wrong on this occasion.;"""I simply wouldn’t trust them""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Outbound (BAH TO DXB): Smooth flight, generous amount of food for such a short flight and it was tasty as well Outbound (DXB to BHX): Disastrous, flight was overbooked and cramped making the staff take a long time to board, we economy passengers were basically treated like cattle. IFE wasn't responsive, and food especially breakfast were bad - portions fit for a child, and mid flight I realized the meals had given me stomach pains and nausea. Inbound (BHX to DXB): Extremely bad service, 3 hours after take off and nothing (not even drinks) were given, my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally, it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals (including my seat mate). Besides that, my meal was terrible barely cooked pasta with a droplet of sauce, dead vegetables that was pathetically called a salad, and I was given a bread roll with nothing to use it with. Crew barely served any drinks, I got massively dehydrated (7hrs flight), and in the morning they refused to serve me breakfast because I woke up 2 hours before landing - not even a coffee or tea was offered to me. Overall, it's was a very below average flight and Emirates is overhyped for nothing.;"""Emirates is overhyped for nothing""";"

Not Verified |  I had booked return flights with wheelchair service for my 60 year old Mom for AMD to DFW and back. The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my mother’s health and age.  While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesn’t have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed? Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but “Her wheelchair is booked”. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airport from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was “Our staff will be there to assist her everywhere”. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with nobody to help. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter. I genuinely liked Emirates but this is very disappointing and inconvenient especially given that mother is a senior citizen. I’ll never fly emirates again.;"""disappointing and inconvenient""";"

The booking was made and fully paid for four months ago. I have been advised by curt email that I have been downgraded to business class, no mention of apology, explanation nor compensation or refund. It gets better, there seems no way of contacting Emirates in New Zealand their advertised phone number is cut off. What a shambles of an airline and we haven't even left the ground.

✅ Trip Verified |  My first experience of Emirates new premium economy class. Food and service excellent. Seats however are a little bit firm and not as comfortable as the pictures suggest. Also the recline is quite big so you can feel a little trapped once the person in front refines. Access to three toilets for 50 plus passengers is a real bonus and you get glimpses of the flight deck if that is an interest. I paid very little in cost difference which was the attraction but Emirates economy is very good in any case so May not always be a choice I am willing to pay much extra for. Also it was a two meal service for a seven hour flight which is good.;"""Food and service excellent""";"

Not Verified |  My sister flew from Houston to Tehran via Dubai. In Houston, she paid $225 for an extra suitcase. The agent asked for cash and said they do not accept credit card but after my sister insisting that she does not have cash, they accepted her credit card.  Upon her arrival to Dubai for her second leg of her flight, she was asked to pay over $300 again. When she showed her receipt and the destination noted, the agent started to scream at her and say, either she pays or she will lose her flight. When she tried to reason, the man started to scream more and louder, and took her passport. My sister told him that she will pay, just tell her how to do it. Then the agent took her to a counter and when she went to pay, the price was increased to $350. She paid with credit card and they wanted the pin to her credit card. She told them the she did not have the PIN as this was not debit.  She decided to pay in cash, so she can leave but the agent got on her face. She was handed a repeat for $285 and she did not get her change back out of $400.  Now, I am scrambling in Houston to find a return flight for her, so she does not have to return to Dubai and moreover, to travel with Emirate. ;"""asked to pay over $300 again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Wish I had read these reviews. I paid over £2,500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. I’m travelling with my wife and 2 babies (1 &2.5 years old). The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours, they suddenly decided to change my original flights, booked only 10 days before, they’ve sent me a text and a short email to say: this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he can’t help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we can’t answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers. Not only are we devastated but also out of pocket by £2,500 because we can’t possibly go on their imposed alternative flight of 21.5 hours with 2 small restless babies. ;"""Wish I had read these reviews""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Avoid this airline at all costs! They forced me to check my carry-on, and then they lost it. Since then, they have not made any attempt to locate it beyond emailing the airport, even though I have called them daily, written to them on Facebook, and submitted multiple complaint forms (they have no answered the complaint forms). I every time I call them, they say ""Ma'am, we've emailed the airport and haven't heard back yet. Please be patient."" I've called the airport, and the representative I spoke with said that Emirates needs to show up in person to locate my missing suitcase - he said that just emailing the airport, as they've done, will accomplish nothing. When I relayed this info to Emirates, they refused to listen. Everyone I've spoken with tries to get off the phone as quickly as possible without taking steps to investigate the issue.

✅ Trip Verified |  A very pleasant trip on Emirates Economy from Dallas to Dubai. EK remains the best in Economy. I couldn't fault this flight at all. Check in was easy and friendly ground handling agents despite Dallas being chaotic due to the storms. Onboard the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The food was plentiful and the IFE was excellent. Wifi was slowish at times but suffice for WhatsApp and communication.

Not Verified |  After being concerned about our Qantas BC flight to Singapore with their issues, we were really looking forward to flying Emirates BC for the 1st time. Qantas blew Emirates out of the water. Worst business class ever. Really disappointed. You pay a lot to fly business class, so the expectation that something as simple as the food to be hot should be expected. Both flights the food was Luke warm. Can't stand cold food. It maybe the size of the A380 business class, but the whole set up seemed cold. Took off, and it was like a conveyor belt. Seat cushion on for sleep. Food orders taken. Place mat down. Crew were like robots, zero warmth. Qantas do the same, but just felt totally different. More customer interaction and dare I say warmth. 777 flight was a little better but the food was still cold. Sorry unacceptable in business class or even economy for that matter. Not looking forward to our flight from Europe back to Singapore in 6 weeks. When you save to fly business class, when the airline gets it wrong you feel ripped off. Yes they got us there in one piece with our luggage so I suppose I should be happy with that. We get to try Singapore Airlines and Turkish Air BC on this trip as well. So these flights on Emirates I dare say will be our last. Quite simply they don't live up to their reputation which is such a shame.;"""they don't live up to their reputation""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with many airlines until à now and it was the worse service I got. The first time I didn’t get my luggage on arrival and no compensation above all. An airlines who allows itself to plan short connection, and arrives late in Dubai, to the price of leaving your luggages behind. And after complaining to the customer service, this is what you get : “ Dear Miss Bacconnet, Thank you for your correspondence. I regret the inconvenience you experienced when your baggage was not available for collection upon you arrival in Paris on 30 May 2022. Our records indicate that your baggage was unintentionally left behind in Dubai and subsequently returned to you. Compensation for delayed baggage is offered to passengers to assist with the purchase of essential items of an immediate need. Passengers who are residents in the country where the claim has been registered are not eligible for this payment. Delayed baggage compensation also does not cover consequential expenses such as hotel accommodation, transportation, loss of income etc. We are not in a position to offer compensation and recommend that you contact your insurance company for assistance. Thank you for the opportunity to respond. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you on board in the near future under more favourable circumstances. Yours sincerely, Emirates Customer Affairs” Apparently, even though I don’t leave in Paris, I don’t have “essential needs” because my country can its residents all their essential needs. It is well known that when you live in a country, everything is free for you. Like I didn’t pay the hotel because I had to wait for my luggage for almost two hours after someone came to me to let me know it’s not gonna come today so that I missed my train back home. Consequently I had to book a night in a hostel because a hotel in Paris is crazy expansive. And as I didn’t have essentials I had to pay not less than 4€ to rent a ridiculous cheap quality towel. The service onboard is not exceptional, the crew is not really willing to help. The AC is crazy low and when you ask for second blanket, it looks like you ask too much. Compared to Qatar there is no free wifi allowance. ;"""was the worse service I got""";"

Not Verified |  Since it was sudden sandstorm on Sunday 14August 2022,our flight was delayed from Bahrain and then Dubai too. Wen we arrived Dubai Airport then Emirates staff gave us Boarding passes and meal vouchers for another rebooking which was 6 hours later and I asked for lounge or some waiting areas from the staff since I carrying 1 month infant with me along 1 child, she denied saying that lounges are all occupied because all flights are delayed. I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible. I was not informed that there will be no announcements on this airport and she did not even tell that your gate may be in another building for which you will have to go by bus or metro which takes another 30-40 minutes at least. Somehow I found a place to feed my baby which was quite far but concourse B was mentioned on my Boarding pass so I thought its near only we went to relax n feed my baby and later our gate was changed to another building and I did not know it will take such long time to reach there. Running through the way we couldn't manage it to the gate, we missed that flight too. I believe Emirates staff should communicate with the passenger clearly about the important information specially when someone like me who is going on Dubai Airport first time. I could get direct flight from Bahrain to Delhi but I wanted my family to experience the service Of Emirates and they experienced the worst experience, partially because of bad weather Delays and partially because of staff's miscommunication or no interest to facilitate the passenger with special need or request. ;"""experienced the worst experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Gold member of Skywards. During a flight departing from Toronto to Dubai the flight crew allowed the children sitting behind me to use my seat as a climbing frame. With no regard for myself or the other passengers within the row nothing was addressed. Eating the served meal was impossible as was any attempt at drinking any fluids. This was drawn to the attention of both the parents and the flight staff all to no avail. If the children were not climbing then they were kicking the back of my seat. The children would seldom sit even during turbulence and during take-off and landing.

Not Verified |  I have flown Emirates extensively in the Lisbon-Dubai route and I find their product rather consistent. This last time check-in took a bit too much than I would expect for Business, but security fast-track works well and is convenient. In Lisbon Emirates uses the TAP lounge which is a bummer as other than being very crowded at all times, it is located before passport control (Schengen area) which forces people to leave much earlier than boarding start. If flying Business in the Boeing 777-300 do choose the front mini-cabin (first 2 rows before the door) as all the 300+ Economy passengers board through the door before the aft cabin leading to an annoying 1h boarding process with people passing by. Food and crew are usually great and very helpful and friendly. At Dubai very easy process to go through priority passport control and to reach the complimentary limo service, all very efficient. I have found some drivers to be quite rude and/or driving dangerously - Emirates should improve their standards for this personnel. All in all, Emirates is one of the few airlines offering a truly distinctive premium service, from the moment you leave home until you set your feet at your destination hotel. I will continue flying with them.;"""one of the few airlines offering a truly distinctive premium service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  My brother in Kenya died suddenly in a construction accident so I had to get a flight home quickly as funerals happen quickly in Kenya. We found a suitable flight with Emirates although it was about triple what I normally pay for a planned flight home. At Birmingham the checkin staff were not very helpful and then the flight to Amsterdam was delayed but I was told not to worry, I would still get my onwards flight from Schipol to Nairobi. However, when I arrived at Amsterdam my flight had departed. I was offered a flight 24 hours later but turned it down as I would miss my brother’s funeral and I would be devastated. I was offered and accepted an alternative flight via Entebbe, Uganda, which I accepted. However, when I arrived at Entebbe I was refused boarding on the flight to Nairobi - Emirates had messed up. I had no money for an alternative flight and no roaming on my phone so I Whattsapp’d my husband in UK and he phoned up Emirates Dubai office at great expense and after half an hour convinced the call handler to book me onto a later flight to Nairobi. I missed my brother’s funeral and I will never forgive Emirates for their incompetence and lack of care. I’ve complained to Emirates and they denied all responsibility blaming factors outside of their control but I don’t believe them. They have offered me some free Air Miles but I will never fly with Emirates again! ;"""I will never fly with Emirates again""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Service is below sub standard. I travelled with my 2 daughters of 2 and 7 years. I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic. I need to think million one times to make another booking with Emirates. Families travelling with kids are not recommended to choose this airline. More dissatisfaction occurred when reporting the above mentioned incidents to the customer support. Hardly any apologies to little reassurance from them too. Overall my travel experience with Emirates was pathetic.;"""Service offered by the airline was below standard""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line. Bags were checked all the way through to Dubai, where we would then have a rest and get a flight to Melbourne the following day. Attempted to board and told our tickets had been cancelled - by us! Somehow in the air from Bergen, we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai - seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go, who to contact, how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets - for being a “no show” which is 100% wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel, footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty / half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service (or lack of customer service!). After a terrible flight home, straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to re-schedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write, email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne, we have had zero response! The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers - it’s all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less. Oh - actually they did offer us a special treat from business class, how could I forget they asked if we wanted a cappuccino from a machine. I don’t drink coffee.;"""lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the most unpleasant business class travel experience I have ever had. My check-in luggage is missing, despite I confirmed with the check-in counter in Dubrovnik multiple times that my luggage will be delivered automatically to Japan without any manual transfer procedure required in Dubai. The WIFI (cost 19.9 usd) I bought onboard doesn't work most of the time. When I went to the toilet shortly before landing, the attendant reluctantly open the door for me. But he kept pushing by saying ""do it really quick"" and even knocked the door irritatedly. He didn't apologise even after I asked him to use proper English and better manner. The company changed the aircraft without notice. I book the aisle seat but it ended up as a window seat. (Another attendant helped me change the seat. That is the only positive experience onboard.)

Not Verified |  The absolute worst airline ever. If you have kids avoid this airline as much as possible. We had two hours of delay on first flight and they did not keep the next flight for 5 minutes for us to catch it, although the tickets were bought connected. They book us on a flight with 14 hours difference the problem was we arrived vey late at night and all shops were closed and they compensated with one night hotel and nothing else. They also has absolutely no priority for kids not in boarding and not for caring a small kid has special need like diapers you can not just easily book them in next day flight at midnight. With all these problems they put on us, they also did not want to let us take our yoyo stroller on board, we had to fight them and without stroller at midnight in a closed airport when they book us on next day flight I do not know what we should do. Terrible is even a good word to describe Emirates. ;"""absolute worst airline ever""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The baggage rules are non consistent with what is displayed on Expedia and once you are at the airport they charge high overweight fees. Even if upgrading my ticket to Flex would have solved the weight limit for a cheaper price the staff refused to make any change. Also, despite the emergency seat being partially free I was not allowed to take one because I haven't paid extra fees upfront for this option. I heard good things about this company, yet as my first experience turned out to be a nightmare I’ll stay far away from this one in the future. I hope ANA will soon resume operating their own flight to France soon.;"""turned out to be a nightmare """;"

✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointing experience. I booked a one way flight for $2000 Email confirmation was not sent till I called emirates three days later after my booking. I am 6’5 feet tall and have bad knees. After boarding, there were at least 3 empty seats at the emergency exit in economy class, I asked the crew if I could change my seat to one the emergency exit empty seat. The reply was you need to pay $200 extra for that. I explained why I need to move to a seat with more leg space and that it’s still an economy seat that no one is using, they simply said sorry we can’t. The whole flight I was shivering and when I asked for an extra blanket the reply was sorry everyone is asking for extra blanket. I has a much better experience with other airlines. Emirates is so overrated unless you are booking on business or first class.;"""Emirates is so overrated""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  In the last 4-years, Emirates customer service has become one of the worst. I doubt they are any better than a 2-star service. Their airport staffs are either rude or cold. Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies. They send me round in circles on 2 different trips, and the issue still remains unresolved after a week. As a gold member, I get a pleasant smile and a warm welcome, but that is just faking a few words that have no value whatsoever. Anytime I requested any help, I more or less got nothing for being Gold. The only thing that remains for being Gold is Fast Check-in in the Dubai airport and a few other airports outside the UAE, Lounge access, and sometimes faster delivery of your check-in baggage. There was a time Emirates was better or as good as Qatar Airways. Overall, EK's poor customer service let it down big time. As a customer, my last 2 experiences have been terrible.;"""customer service has become one of the worst""";"

After disembarking, we were told we would get hotel accommodation. Instead, we were sent from pillar to post and ended up standing outside the airport in the cold until past 2am when I arranged transport, at my own cost to get home. No communication, no one to explain anything. Staff were not helpful at all and neither were the ground staff. Disappointing, won't use them again if I have a choice.

When we were checking in, looks like only 1 cabin baggage is allowed (and no personal item) while you are flying out from India. This was not the case when I was flying in from the USA. Looks like this is the rule only from India. We were charged a very high price of 35,000 Rupees for just 2 personal items which was a backpack and handbag. We had no choice but to pay.

✅ Trip Verified |  At Algiers airport, the lounge is lifeless.  In the plane, the power receptacle is broken on my seat but luckily no one was sitting next to me to use his. The live TV did not work and the images are distorted. The live TV displays a few frames then freezes for a minute or so before displaying more frames. I was trying to watch the football game between ManU and Chelsea. The food (we were fasting) they left by your seat and then it took another 15 minutes to bring nuts and drinks after Maghrib. I just wanted soup for Iftar. In addition, when I was asked to choose my entree, it was not available. The seat I had 11A was very noisy. Usually they distribute pouches with socks, toothbrush and toothpaste and a blind mask in addition to ear plugs which would have been helpful. After all this is business class. The only bright thing in this upgrade is that the hostesses were brilliant and even tolerated my displeasure with these inconveniences in a nice way. In any case, this is the worst business class experience flying Emirates ever. Most likely it will be my last at least on this route. This is their reply: Dear Mr Boutrid, Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2022 regarding Emirates flight EK 758 from Algiers to Dubai on 28 April. I am concerned to learn of your disappointment with the lounge at Algiers airport. This lounge is operated by a service provider. Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew. I regret that you did not enjoy our product offering as much as we would have liked.;"""the worst business class experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  It was a round trip with Emirates from Delhi to Dubai and antagonistic experience in both journeys. Ground staff at Dubai was very rude and unhelpful whereas in India the check in was way easier despite of huge rush. We were stuck and struggling for self check in (which we were guided again and again by the limited staff available) and finally after half an hour when our check in baggage got stuck on the belt and we again have to helplessly ask for help for which the lady at the counter replied us to wait for 2-3 minutes. After 10 minutes when nobody turned up my husband reminded the same lady at the counter that we need help to which she replied I am on some other report and we should proceed towards manual counter. We were shocked! My husband reminded her that our baggage is stuck to which she responded with irritation and called some technical staff to provide our baggage. Then we proceeded towards manual counter where again with technical glitches our check in was done in half an hour when all our documents were properly in place. In short more than an hour to check in at Dubai airport with Emirates without rush whereas in India within an hour we were done with check in, security and immigration! My suggestion to the passengers travelling from Emirates please don't expect soft spoken and helpful staff specially at Dubai airport and have spare time in hand to bear with the glitches.;"""antagonistic experience in both journeys""";"

No Priority boarding, No pre fight drinks offered, no enhanced meal service, no separation of section resulting in long queues for the bathroom from others in Economy. On arrival into UK no priority baggage collection. As a frequent traveller of this service with other airlines the offerings from Emirates fall severely short. Its a shame as the seat was comfortable and if all the missing elements were there would convert me to continue to use Emirates airlines for all my travelling requirements. I hope that these offerings will be addressed in the very near future as I felt a little cheated by paying for the upgrade with no real enhancement of service apart from a seat!;"""offerings from Emirates fall severely short""";"

✅ Trip Verified | MXP-JFK-MXP in F. I found a solid product and comfort on board but service from the staff was just OK. There is a lack of personal touch throughout the whole flight experience from check-in procedure that was very cold both ways to the inflight mode. I always felt like an economy class pax on the ground both at check-in and in the lounge both in Italy & USA. Far different from what you feel flying QR in business for instance. Return flight on A6-EEA was disappointing because the aircraft was showing his age: my suite was completely worn out, sliding doors broken. EK should pay attention to this details and make sure everything is renewed especially in premium cabins where there is too much difference between aircraft to aircraft for A380's in their fleet. The food was very good quality in both legs. JFK-MXP flight was below average because of the service that was either too slow for the main meal or too rushed during breakfast. Shower SPA: both ways good experience the bathroom is huge with plenty of amenities and this is the real plus rather than the shower itself. Overall I think business class is the only product that worth the premium price for EK.;"""business class is the only product that worth the premium price for EK""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Emirates services are getting worse day by day, I had my flight from Dubai to New York where i had my connecting flight for Nassau, which they changed the time and destination to Newark. The bag drop counter was closed, so I had to take all my luggage to the counter of JetBlue to checkin. When I reached Jet blue the attendants were not helpful at all said the counter is closed and my flight departure times has been changed from 7am to 10am. And they are unable to take my luggage and won't provide any accommodations that I should take my complaints to emirates counter. Emirates ground staff refused to help said I should contact customer service. As I did not have a USA number I had to use my roaming services to call Emirates customer service, after 45 mins being on call i was told that they cannot help and I need to contact ground staff of Emirates. When I went back to Emirates ground staff they said they can't do anything as it was their closing time. Not to mention my flight from Ewr to Nassau also kept getting delayed. I was stranded at the airport as I was not able to arrange a hotel because by the time I could finish all this run around and phone calls it was almost midnight. The only option to eat was dunkin donuts. Worst part was both Jetblue which was affiliated with Emirates and staff of Emirates did not showed any regrets. They cared less if I was being helped or directed. I bought my ticket from the website of Emirates and this was my worst experience ever. I will always avoid flying with this airline.;"""getting worse day by day""";"

At Cochin on my way back on Sun, 29th May, they wouldn’t allow my carryon citing allowance limit. Didn’t have a second bag and had to carry my laptop and electronics in a duty free bag to LAX. Happy to comply with rules, but they can’t and shouldn’t be discriminatory. LAX and COK can’t have different rules for the same tickets and airlines. Many passengers in economy from COK were in violation of the number of carryons and weight limit as stated on the tickets.

Great service from the cabin crew, who were attentive, but also had a great sense of humour and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the flight. A light breakfast was served after departure from Dubai, with fresh fruits and breads. Lunch served about 2 hours before arrival into LHR. My wife and I chose the Fish tahta as a main course. This was roasted Kingfish in spicy rice, really tasty and generous portion. The Emirates Bar is a great feature on the A380 and we enjoyed a cocktail and a laugh and joke with the cabin crew.

Emirates use the Air Mauritius Les Salons Amedee Maingard lounge, which is ok but not the standard of a typical Emirates Lounge. Flight boarded and departed on time. As this is an overnight flight Emirates serve a dinner service soon after take-off. I had the Chicken Biryani, which was OK. Unfortunately for my wife, who was being served from the other aisle, their system failed and they forgot to serve my wife’s main course.

✅ Trip Verified | Our first flight since the pandemic. Check in at LGW was quick and efficient. Made our way to the Emirates lounge as we had a couple of hours to spare. Service was good in the lounge and after about 15 minutes they served a hot lunch. The Goan Chicken Curry was pleasant. Flight boarded and departed on time. My wife and I had seats 14E and 14F which are ideal for a couple travelling together. At the time of travel masks were mandatory, Emirates provided spare masks and sanitizer. The food service on Emirates used to be quite drawn out but with the new system they take the meal selection from the passengers on a hand held device and it seems to be delivered in quite an efficient manner. I chose the Arabic Mezze, which was very tasty followed by the Beef Tenderloin, which was also good. Good choice of wine available. Emirates only serve one meal on the flight from Gatwick to Dubai, which we found to be sufficient. Snacks and sandwiches are available at any time, either delivered to your seat or from the bar.

✅ Trip Verified | Superb service from Emirates. I had to cancel my flight due to illness only 2 weeks before departure and phoned the Lisbon office. After pressing 2 buttons I was talking to a rep after less than 2 minutes. Much to my surprise, for a base ticket, he said I was entitled to a refund and sent me a refund form. Nothing arrived for a month so I again phoned and the mistake I had made in completing the refund form was explained and another sent. After only 2 weeks a partial refund for 'no show' was credited to my account and when I queried why 'no show' for a cancellation I received an apologetic mail confirming full refund which duly arrived after only 10 days. This compares with Ryanair who will fight tooth and nail to avoid any, even legitimate, refund. Guess where my loyalties will lie in future - Emirates!;"""Superb service from Emirates""";"

Not so good was trying to get to a toilet in the middle of the night and having to make my way past lots of drunken passengers filling the bar area at the back of the A380 - which is also the area where the toilets are. I suggest this Lounge area could be made a barista coffee lounge instead (as much as I like a glass of wine). All flights pretty much on time.

✅ Trip Verified |  Only the second time I choose to fly Emirates, so I will not make a fast decision as to use this airline again or not. But I have to say that in all the years I have been flying business, the CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace. From the chaotic boarding in Paris when all first and business class passengers were held at the gate for 25 minutes (apparently for no reasons except that some sort of VIP showed up at some point and cut the line), without so much as an announcement from the person in charge. Once everyone was on board, the first announcement from the captain was about an hour delay in getting a takeoff slot. As we pushed back, their APU went out, no lights and aircon and back to the gate. Then some very vague information from the flight deck on some repairs being done, and another slot waiting time. Anyway the whole deal lasted 3 hours. Ok, that is a technical problem, it happens and that is the way it is. What bothered me during the whole time was the complete disdain of the cabin crew for the passengers. As a matter of facts, most of them seemed to enjoy the delay and were having some very long and loud conversations with some apparent friends in the aisles. The flight finally took off. And this is when the cabin crew showed its complete inability to handle the most basic service. Absolutely no care for the passengers, and except for some meal served in a hurry (during which I actually had to beg for a glass of wine previously ordered ) we only got to see them once in a while during the whole 7,5 hours. I want to think that this was a bad timing, or else. On the other end, the second leg of the flight from DXB to Moscow was excellent, and I actually found out how much was missing on the first leg then: Friendly and helpful cabin crew, good service. After all this is what we ask for in a flight! My rating will be below at 5. Zero for first leg, 10 for second leg.;"""CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I am retired and fly frequently. Couple days ago (May 5), I went to Tehran Int. Airport (IKA) to travel to U.S.A. When I arrived at the Emirate ticketing counter in order to obtain my boarding pass, I experienced a bad situation which I have never had with any other airlines. The ticketing lady had a very bad attitude told me to show her my Covid test result which I did, then asking for Vaccination card that I responded that I am USA citizen and there is no need to have this card, which she started talking loud and being so rude, finally I found my card and passed it to her. After that I was glad that the issue was resolved and now she would process my luggage. I was wrong. She laid back at her chair and doing nothing. Finally I said to her this checking takes long time, please process my luggage. At the end I went to her team leader and explained her behavior. I am sure that the leader would not do anything to correct his group attitudes, because all of them are the same and they do not know any better, but I am sure that Emirates will lose more customers as times pass. From now on, I will broadcast and pass this bad experience to my friends and relatives and telling them not to fly with Emirates.;"""telling them not to fly with Emirates""";"

"✅ Trip Verified | They cancelled my initial flight from KHI to DXB and rebooked the flights which ended up me having 15 hours layover in Dubai. KHI-DXB, check in was friendly, flight was on time, clean plane, food was outstanding for a flight not even 2 hours long, crew was very friendly and attentive. Blankets and extra pillow were given. Landed in Dubai, went to the Dubai connect desk as it says on their website that if you have more than 10 hours layover, Emirates will provide you accommodation, at the desk, the guy was rude and straight up said Karachi office should have booked you earlier (Karachi office is the one that told me to contact Emirates at Dubai as they have no authority to book anything with Dubai Connect) and I was also told that even a prior booking was made, it would have been cancelled because accommodation is only available for passengers who bought tickets worth more than $1000 USD. Then I went back to the connection desk, explained the whole situation all over again, guy at the desk started blaming me that I am the one who chose to have a longer layover so it's not Emirates problem, he kept ignoring that key information that ""Emirates is the one who cancelled the flight from KHI to DXB, not me"". I have to admit, I became a Karen when he told me Emirates can't offer you anything, no compensation no food, nothing for a 15 hours layover. I refused to listen to him any further and demanded to see a manager right away, he ran back and got the manager at the desk, manager was extremely polite and apologetic, instructed to hand me over 2 meal vouchers immediately (previously I was told Emirates do not have any meal voucher offers etc, so that was the lie). So guys, if you want to be treated fairly by Emirates, you gotta fight hard. DXB to CDG, flight was on-time, full. Crew was very attentive, plane was spotless, food was disgusting. They served feta cheese sandwiches, they were absolutely inedible and were freezing cold as well that it hurts you teeth. Then the lights were switch off so it was good sleep with enough legroom. Breakfast was served an hour before landing and main hot breakfast was inedible as well, fruit portion was fresh but the bread roll was so cold that I couldn't slice or bite it (should learn from Turkish, they serve soft warm rolls). I have also noticed many people didn't eat the hot portion of the breakfast. I have to give a shout-out to one particular crew member, she handled the situation very well when she was yelled at by a grumpy middle age man when she asked him, if he would like to have a breakfast, he started yelling at her that ""no, I'm sleeping, can you see, stop yelling into my ears"". Honestly I wanted to intervene but there was no need to as she handled it quite well but I can tell, he kinda ruined her day.";"""if you want to be treated fairly by Emirates, you gotta fight hard""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Emirates has been using the 777 to serve HKG ever since the start of the pandemic, it used to be the A380. The 777 has a strange business class configuration of 2x3x2. Who wants to be the unlucky fellow to sit in the middle of the 3, paying premium price? The service is OK but not great either. Food was as bland as ever, the seat is really narrow and uncomfortable. OK for a short to medium haul flight up to about 6 hours, anything longer than that would be an ordeal. Still, one redeeming grace is that, they sell this short leg at a very attractive price, so that is acceptable.;"""seat is really narrow and uncomfortable""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Ok, I have not even started my journey yet and they cancelled my Karachi - Dubai flight, re-booked me (without even consulting with me) and I ended up with a new booking which means, instead of landing in Paris at 9am in the morning, I will be landing at 2pm. I have booked this trip in Jan, already paid for a domestic flight from Paris to Lyon that departs from Paris at noon on a same day I land there. Called Emirates, explained them the whole situation, even sent them a receipt of 100 euro plane (non-refundable) ticket I have already bought from Paris to Lyon, all they said, sorry, but that's not our problem if you gonna miss your connecting flight to Lyon. I kept on insisting that I must take the original schedule flight from DXB to CDG as planned so they must fix it. After a long argument, I am good to fly but with 15 hours layover at Dubai. I asked them for an accommodation through Dubai connect program, they refused to book anything or even provide a meal voucher (like Qatar Airways) reasoning that I am the one choosing to not to fly to Paris on immediate available connection, therefore, no accommodation or food for you. Their telephone rep people are so rude (not the Karachi one, Dubai helpline), literally telling me they don't care if I'm going to miss my connecting flight and that's not Emirates headache. Will provide an update on this journey once I will land in Paris. Stay tuned.;"""I ended up with a new booking""";"

Not Verified |  Friends, do yourself a favor and do not book with Emirates. They are extremely unreliable and will cancel your flight at last minute. We flew from Chicago to Dubai to Amman and they ended up canceling our flight from Dubai to Amman. They rescheduled us for the next flight with a 18 hour layover with a 2 year old. We ended up needing to push our flight one day which made us lose precious time with our family that we haven’t seen in 3 years. Then our flight home from Amman to Dubai to Chicago, ended up being canceled again and now we are trying to change it because I have my sisters wedding the next day. I may be forced to miss it because of emirates irresponsibility to keep flights as they are when you book. Also, the food is horrendous and give no vegetarian options, I had to survive off the snacks I bought before hand and what the flight attendants gave me. I had to wait on hold for 2 hours to speak to someone for a cancellation they made. Save yourself the headache and avoid Emirates . I wish I did. You have lost a customer for life.

✅ Trip Verified | On reading all the post COVID reviews of Emirates, I need to take a contrary stance to all the complaints and mumbles. It was my first Emirates experience in 3 years, and as far as I was concerned nothing had changed, apart from the boarding procedure in Dubai which was nothing short of shambolic - but that is the airport, not the airline. As a direct result of the ineptitude of the gate staff we pushed back 1 hour 20 mins late. No matter. The service was friendly and efficient - nothing was too much trouble - and the food and drink really good. One doesn’t often have memorable meals on board any aircraft (preparation of same must be trying in the extreme), but the lunch served was top notch. A bonus in business class on board an A380 is the on board bar area, once again, service was excellent. I had a thoroughly enjoyable experience and look forward to my next Emirates experience.;"""The service was friendly and efficient""";"

I had informed the cabin attendant my seat was wrong and that I paid extra money for my seat (and showed her my printed paperwork). They weren’t concerned. I looked at my original seat and someone else was seating in my seat. They charge me for a seat I didn’t get, then RE-SOLD my seat to someone else.

✅ Trip Verified |  The flight commenced boarding 20 minutes prior to departure time. The gate lounge was jammed full with no space to sit or stand. A small boy vomited on the floor in the gate area. I informed an Emirates ground agent to call a cleaner and was given a blank stare. Passengers walked through the vomit and no clean-up was done. Boarding was unorganized with no sense of order. The aircraft pushed back approximately two hours after departure time. An announcement was made by a pilot stating the delay was due to 'baggage handling technical problems.' The digital menu was not working. I asked a cabin crew what was on the menu, and they stated to ask another crew member. Toilets were not clean and were smelly. I requested a drink in the galley from a cabin crew and he pointed to cups and a bottle of water and said 'get it yourself.' Cabin temperature was freezing cold. The seat was comfortable. Baggage arrived on two separate baggage carousels in SYD. This made baggage collection complicated and confusing. Overall, a comfortable flight but nothing special. I have had better on-time performance, service, and cabin cleanliness from low cost carriers.;"""comfortable flight but nothing special""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Well it seems a post-Covid Emirates is a very different airline and a different experience to beforehand. The previous high quality service, little touches that made you feel a valued customer and friendly attendants onboard are all gone, vanished. Instead they've replaced this with grumpy attendants who don't pay attention to the customer, little things like noticing a low drink and filling it up before you have to ask, welcoming returning loyal customers - these are the things you pay for with Emirates and in Business class, now it might as well be a long Ryanair flight. They have lost all the caring aspects that gave them an edge, if you are going to fly to the middle east then use Qatar or even Turkish. Their seats are still comfy as anything, I'll give them that.;"""They have lost all the caring aspects that gave them an edge""";"

I called Emirates and they said I would be unable to fly back but that they could keep my ticket and place it on hold. When I went to change the date to fly back, they made me pay the fare difference. In this case, the cheapest fare difference I could get within a two week period was $400. How an airline can you charge you for getting covid is insane. I’m so disappointed and upset. Their customer service team on the phone was awful. I will never fly with Emirates again after this experience. I didn’t ask for covid, and got financial punished for it.;"""I’m so disappointed and upset""";"

✅ Trip Verified | First Emirates flight ever. Food was served on a tray mis sized to the seat tray so difficult to keep in place. Food was hot but otherwise tasteless. Food for special orders is served 15 to 30 minutes before beverage cart comes by so only water on tray available to consumer. I paid extra for better seats but given the service and noise environment, it probably was a waste. Cabin is drafty, video headsets do not fit anyone, noise during my flights (esp. to SEA) was excessive. Airline does not address selected and/or comfortable seating for passengers with infants. Four infants on my flight were training talk show hosts as their lungs and screams lasted the entire 15 hour flight to SEA. The plane was full and staff gave little concern for passengers. On arrival in SEA the airline took forever (1.5 hours) to get luggage to customer even though I had a first class luggage tag on my one bag. Onward booking by airline had incorrect boarding info for ongoing flight and barely made the connection. Cannot imagine what others waited and how many missed connections. Yes, SEA is an airport to avoid for customs and general connection flights. But airline is responsible for getting luggage unloaded and Emirates failed customers but staff luggage was first off and first picked up. I will never fly Emirates ever. The problems were not a full plane or infants, the problem was the airline treating their customers like cattle and not taking action to address an unrestful environment.;"""the problem was the airline treating their customers like cattle""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  This was the worst experience that I've ever had with any company. My flight from NY to Dubai was delayed. After arriving late to Dubai for my connection flight to Male, I was informed by Emirates staff to go to luggage claims to get my luggage for my next emirates flight to Male. My luggage never came through after 40 mins. I informed an Emirates employee and they claimed that my luggage was already loaded onto my next flight. Upon going through customs, I missed my flight, so I was stuck in Dubai. I was forced to wait in 3 different long lines for a total of 5 hrs, just to be told that because I was a no show, I had to pay a $1200 fee. I informed the Emirates representative of what happened and they became rude and walked away. After 5 hrs I was able to speak to someone who understood situation and got me a next morning flight for my destination of Male. Upon receiving my new flight I was stranded in the airport for 17hrs before my 2:30am flight. On my original flight I paid for a extra legroom seat, but on the rescheduled flight I was forced to sit in a standard seat that really hurt my legs. After taking the grueling flight to Male, my luggage never came. I reported the incident to Male airport staff and they started an investigation for my luggage. I finally was able to take a transfer to maldives, but without any clothes or luggage. This entire situation ruined my vacation because this was over the weekend. So I'm at a resort with no change of clothes, and no toiletries. Emirates airlines turned my dream vacation into a nightmare.

I was going and picking up the things my little daughter needed and I was very annoyed but they did not pay attention and when I got off the plane I was the last passenger to get off because I was waiting for them to take my luggage from the bottom of the plane and give it to me and my daughter.

✅ Trip Verified |  We were eligible for Dubai connect service wherein we would be accommodated for the duration of our 9 hour transit in Dubai if we have a connecting Emirates flight. I was travelling for the first time with my newborn and with covid being stressful enough and all the paperwork required to travel, Emirates whipped up a whammy by not arranging for me transit visa even after I organised this a month in advance as directed by Emirates Dubai connect. Their incompetence gave me a hard time travelling with my baby who was very tired after a long flight and since we trusted Emirates notifications, we got to the airport desk to find out our visas were not organised and had to wait 2 hours in the airport for this. I could have easily paid for my visa weeks in advance and had a hassle free experience but even with repeated enquiries with Emirates customer service, I was told the visa was complimentary and not to worry about it. Truly horrifying experience and they never managed to compensate their messing up with anything. I had to pay for my airport hotel stay as we were not willing to wait two hours for just visa processing and then going out of the airport for their complimentary stay. Also, the fact that Dubai airport is so huge makes things more difficult with a baby to be walking a lot. All in all, very bad experience and would not recommend Emirates.;"""Truly horrifying experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying Emirates out of Houston on 29th November 2021 and i had purchased extra luggage. When i got there i was told it was per piece not per KG and i had to pay more. i agreed and tried to give them cash, they refused and insisted that i must pay by credit card which i did not have, eventually an argument ensued and their assistant mgr came and instead of resolving the conflict, he told me not to board the flight and i left. I have been asking for my refund from Emirates and they said i did not meet their conditions of carriage because of an argument.  I was perplexed and i have been asking for my refund and they provided no proof whatsoever to back up their claims.  I am still asking for my money or a new ticket from Emirates. Customer Affairs asked me to contact their security which i did and the security said it had nothing to do with them. They were essentially giving me the run around instead of being professional. The agent asked me to go ahead and claim a refund for the unused sector which i did but was denied, i have sent her multiple mails and she does not respond to emails or calls.

✅ Trip Verified | EK020, 26/01, Evening flight, easy good check-in but soon became aware afternoon flight had been cancelled so they were amalgamating flights. A380 gate at MAN is always hard work but this was totally chaotic with ground staff failing to get a grip. We queued for 20 mins to board but found we were in the wrong queue, the one to get reallocated from the cancelled flight. This was because staff failed to tell anyone what was going on. 90 mins late we took off, full flight. It was ok but the number of babes in arms crying meant no sleep, food was the usual but due to being full it was slow. On arrival we were all herded without announcement for an additional no option PCR test which was also chaotic, although it was free. Return flight EK19 on 10/02 was better serviced, on time and food was better but yet again the crying babes meant no sleep whatsoever.

Not only did they refund only about 20% of the price I paid but they also didn't refund my miles I used for this flight. In my opinion this is very misleading advertising.

✅ Trip Verified |  We had the most horrific experience with Emirates travelling from Spain to Sydney. Our flight was delayed by an hour from Barcelona. We let the crew know multiple times that we had a connection to catch. They told us not to worry, there'll be ground crew waiting for us once we land and will make sure we don't miss our connection. But #Emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight, this was 6 hrs before landing. Once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid-way the #Emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation. They're rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived, tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew. Also both my partner & I had picked up a cold virus (not Covid, got the negative PCR) and felt horrible. We were both feverish, barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly. First they gave us seats far away from each other twice. I couldn't understand how they could make the same mistake twice. Second they told us we can't get the exit row seat, we'd paid extra for. They told me, it wasn't their responsibility to refund the money and I should request if from Emirates.  I just requested that we wouldn't be seated near any small babies and they said fine. They kept telling us to collect our luggage, but with the condition my partner and I were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up, it was impossible. So we said no. Since no one was helping and it was 3 am, we thought to go and check in to our hotel & sleep. We were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it, go visit the Dubai Expo and all. But things just started getting worst. We were in nightmarish state until we got home. We had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel. The Emirates crew at the Airport entrance couldn't help us with Expo tickets, cause they didn't care. We had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours. And the hotel had no amenities. After multiple arguments, the meal problem was fixed, which wasn't that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries. We'd to go and buy clothes, toothbrush, deodorant, etc for ourselves which was a waste of money. The hotel couldn't even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining. We survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine, were actually not. We ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration, there were empty seats at the end of the plane, they just didn't bother to check for us. I did ask for a change of seat at the gate and in flight and every time I was told there were no empty seats. We arrived at Syd airport in a chaotic situation to collect our luggage. They'd given the wrong belt, so everyone spent an hour at luggage collection. ;"""the most horrific experience""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  This was a poor experience from start to finish.  Arrived at the airport to find there was a four-hour delay to the flight. Emirates, however, did not check in bags so no one could go through security or otherwise move to an area with seats available (there were about 30 seats in the area for 200+ passengers). There was very little communication about what problem, if any, caused the delay. Ultimately, Emirates did begin check-in and then began a shuffle of repeated delays until, about seven hours later, Emirates cancelled the flight. Very little communication. ""Maybe there will be a flight tomorrow."" Called Emirates and no answer. Tried online chat without success. Ultimately turned to twitter to get rebooked (had onward flight). This in turn led to the agent trying to charge me an additional several thousand dollars because of fare differential between flying days. I pushed back hard on that, but got the sense Emirates simply sought to profit. Agent tried to put me on a flight in which I would miss my connection to a city served only once every five days by air. Emirates, unlike other airlines, won't book passengers on cancelled flights onto other airlines. Ultimately, Emirates added an additional flight the following day. Told us to get to airport four hours before, but then wouldn't check-in rebooked flight until two hours before so the two flights wouldn't get confused (why then have us in area with no seats and tell us to just stand there for several hours?). Onboard, seats were cramped. My child got a ""kids meal"" she didn't ask for which consisted of one burnt chicken nugget! Service was lackluster.

I as well as almost all of the passengers had to wait for over one hour staring at the carousel for our luggage to come out. We landed on time and going through customs was very fast. Arrival was at about 9 pm, I was done with customs by 9:20 pm, BUT I had to wait at carousel 1 from 9:20 pm until 10:45 to get my luggage. Although Emirates may say that they're not responsible for what happens outside the airline, the passenger is charged a fee for going through Newark Airport, and therefore the airline is also responsible. One other issue which may seem unimportant, but it actually is very important: The entertainment is extremely difficult to use as I when I played a movie a radio station presenter came on with advertisements. Despite trying several times, I could not get it to go to movie sound mode. Ground service I place a one star as I said earlier, Emirates is also responsible for the huge delay of not only my, but almost all of the passenger's luggage.;"""getting my luggage was a nightmare!""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I have booked a flight on Emirates and it clearly stated refundable / cancelable. due to covid cases and lockdowns I had to cancel the flight but unfortunately they did not refund me but instead issued airline credit which also expires. As I live in the UK I would only be traveling via Emirates if there is a stop over in UAE which is not the case. I contacted Emirates and they said sorry but this is the rule knowing it was clearly stated otherwise. I am really disappointed as I know Emirates is a big airline and other smaller airlines have refunded me for similar cases during this period. simply unacceptable;"""issued airline credit which also expires""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a return flight from Manchester to Kolkata and back with Emirates. On the way to Kolkata I missed the connecting flight and used a different flight to reach Kolkata. While at Kolkata, I tried to contact Emirates customer service. The Emirates office in Kolkata has been closed for a long time because of Covid so the only way to contact them was through phone. I have regularly called Emirates contact number and waited for hours to speak to an advisor. When I could not get through over the phone. I emailed Emirates twice. Although emails were acknowledged but never got any response back. On 5th December, I turned up at the airport for my return flight but I was refused boarding the return flight. Emirates customer service said that my flight was cancelled because I missed connecting flights. Emirates did not make any efforts to contact me or refund my booking. I went through lots of stress just because of Emirates terrible customer service.;"""terrible customer service""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK. Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts. Miss May, I do hope that you will continue to choose Emirates in the future.";"""Emirates left us stranded in Muscat""";"

✅ Trip Verified | My flight 585 and subsequent 241 were a nightmare to me. I found Emirates service grossly poor and discriminatory, and full of mistakes and ignorance. My observations are below, and I am requesting Emirates to consider them seriously: 1) I found a few of the messages in Bengali are incorrect, attached one for your ready reference 2) No Bengali Entertainment at all, despite a lot of Bangladeshi people, travel through Emirates. (All Indian Regional Movies were there and even though Japanese) 3) Flight started after an hour late, and no announcement was made, and you failed to meet timeline, attached photo as a ready reference 4) No sound system was provided, and repeated requests were made to provide one but ignored 5) In-flight attendants were not responded to, while they were called several times by the passenger (I tried three times but no response) 6) Food options were not there and only asked to take what was available like either vegetarian or chicken 7) Disembarkation took very long, almost an hour, and no announcement made to inform passengers 8) The cleanliness of the cabin was not satisfactory at all 9) COVID-19 supplies were inadequate and discriminatory (No kit provided other than a hand sanitizer tube).;"""The cleanliness of the cabin was not satisfactory at all""";"

Not Verified |  Great and consistent service given by the crew, especially the steward serving the cabin from row 24 till 36. He helped with finding space in the overhead bins for cabin bags, was very friendly and motivated, and provided excellent service. During the entire flight he paid attention on passengers wearing their face mask, and made remarks to the ones not wearing it. In the past (before Covid19), I experienced some flights where service was lacking and unsatisfied, but this was a pleasant experience. Only negative point is the self check-in at Dubai Airport. People are guided to self check-in machines, also elderly and less frequent flyers, big families, and it takes very long time to have their check-in completed. Especially when they have excess baggage and already half of the bags have been send through. After completing check in, still have to queue up for passport and PCR verification at another Emirates desk, which makes the self check-in less convenient. Nevertheless great experience again.;"""a pleasant experience""";"

The coach seats were comfortable, with a good amount of leg room and the IFE had a wide variety of movies, TV, and audio to keep me occupied.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I reunited in Seychelles in August 2021 after being separated by the pandemic. We had planned to return to the Philippines where she is a citizen. Upon checking in for our first flight with Emirates, the supervisor said I needed a visa since I was a USA citizen. We attempted to explain that Philippines allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. However, the supervisor stated their system did not list these other provisions. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan had been allowed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily. We agreed to follow up during normal business hours since this was Friday night. When I asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry with my wife. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. We incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And our connecting airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success. I did not receive any corrected documentation about the offloading, any financial compensation or flight credits, not even an apology acknowledging their initial mistake! Each time they continued to cordially reiterate that they took ""the matter seriously"" and ""have nothing further to add."" International travelers, especially Filipinos, should beware flying Emirates! They're playing the role of immigration without the knowledge or authority to do so. The online complaint system for Emirates is a travesty of a mockery! You can only upload 2 documents at a time. And you can't make multiple submissions without waiting for Emirates to reply. A week or two later. There's no one you can talk to about matters like this by phone either! I asked to speak with supervisors and managers multiple times without any success. Each time they referred me to the (useless) online complaint system. I don't even know why they bothered to send me delayed replies. They didn't address any concern or ever explain why the airport supervisors could approve me to rebook and board but the online customer service could make say something completely different.";"""online complaint system is a mockery""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Following an incident of the flight being moved to the next day (which can happen and was an uncontrollable unfortunate incident). But, what was controllable, was the level of customer service. No customer should be told that they cannot rebook with another airline after an airline has breached they ticket contract or else they would not receive a hotel voucher. I believe this is the era of choice? The customer doesn’t put themselves in the unfortunate position of an airline being in breach of their airline ticket. And should a customer then choose another airline to reach their destination, the airline should know that the customer did not choose to have to rebook a flight. Nevertheless, the flight a customer chooses should be entirely up to them, given the option. Emirates should never try to hold people hostage after they mess up!  Customers should never be ridiculed for not choosing an airline they no longer trust. Emirates needs a serious training of their staff on customer service, or simply just learn the term, because what I experienced should just not be an experience anyone goes through.;"""needs a serious training of their staff""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Never again on Emirates. The business class seats are narrower than those on EVA Air, Singapore and Qatar. They are also not real full-flat sleeper seats as they do not recline to 180 degrees. For a very large business class cabin seating 50+ it has two small, narrow, windowless lavatories. On this flight one of the lavatories flooded and remained so on the entire route. The wine selection was decent but the food was utterly inedible and honestly hideous to look at. All I could eat was the soup and it was heavily salted. I've had much better food in economy class of poorly rated airlines. Last and least, the entertainment system was difficult to operate. Was anything good? Yes, the staff was excellent and so was the car service. I take four or more international business class trips a year and have never encountered something worse than Emirates, both Newark to Athens and Athens to Newark.;"""the food was utterly inedible and honestly hideous to look at""";"

This was not the case earlier. Emirates Mexico team was sitting on this information for 2 months and have never updated to a passenger. They have my email id, contact number and still they don't bring up this requirement. My wife was travelling to India for delivery and everything was planned.

✅ Trip Verified |  Emirates canceled tickets and did not propose anything on how to fly and did not make a full refund! If you use Emirates, you can stay without a ticket and without money. I had two tickets for this flight on 13 July. On 4 July, I was informed that Emirates had canceled the flight. I contacted Emirates customer services and asked about any alternative flight, and they answered that they could not do it. They proposed later flights on 16 July, but it was impossible for us because we had visas valid until 14 July. I told him about it. So, they suggested requesting a refund, I did it, but they refunded a small percentage of ticket costs. I had two two-way tickets that cost 800 USD each. They refunded 188 USD for one and 250 USD for another for one-way tickets. Then I knew that Emirates for such a canceled flight suggested Turkish airlines, but the customer service did not suggest this option for me.  I am very disappointed that Emirates canceled the flight and did not suggest how to fly from departure to the final destination. Besides, they refunded not the full amount of one-way ticket costs. I wrote feedback-complaint several times to Emirates, and they answered that the flights had been canceled according to the OAE government and could not help me. ;"""did not make a full refund""";"

We got according to new tickets, that we had to stay in Dubai almost 3 days for connecting flight!!!! And I discovered it by chance! When I called to agent to fix this problem, she told me that I have to pay $1,000 extra because they do not have same class tickets, while it was not my choice to change travel dates. I had to go in person to ticketing agent to solve the problem with return tickets dates to be able to come back to work in time after vocation.  The ticketing agent said, that to be able to return on that date I will have to stay in Dubai 25 hours while on initial reservation it was 17 hours. I asked about a complimentary hotel and she tried but failed to book it in the system , and offered to do it later.

We did pay over $1500 dollars for that ticket after all. Mind you we even had the e-ticket from Emirates with the confirmation and everything.

✅ Trip Verified |  A big scam! For a family of five with a little child with us, spending nine hours at the airport was really a very bad experience. I booked my flight in April and I chose a three-hour connection for the august 13 trip from Tunisia to Bahrain. The eve of the flight, I found out that the flight has changed and the connection had been extended from three to nine hours. I spend more than one hour running with my kids and suitcases from one connection desk to another trying to get a lounge to spend the night but in vain. No one at the airport knew what they were doing. I finally went to the only hotel in the airport and to my surprise, we had to pay more than 3000UAE dirhams to stay overnight! Did I ask for my trip to be suddenly changed? Did I ask for my connection to be extended? Did the company notify me and provide me with a hotel room to spend the night with my kids?

During airport procedures I was injured with a small finger cut so once we are in the air after switching off seat belts sign I pinched the attendant button, and for 40 min no one came, to the limit I went to attendants place to request band aid. I have a boy and a girl where one got served with kids food and the other not for 30 min till I stood up again and requested for the food, and the answer I was provided that “sorry the oven is broke”. I had to take the same airline traveling back to Dubai for some work and I hoped to have a different experience, once I approached the check in counter I was informed that the flight is delayed with 105 min, and the flight took off  Delayed more with 150 min.  I wrote to customer service to compensate such loss who took them 2 days to reply my complain explaining how they are aiming for best customer service and trying to be number 1 and by the end they told me nothing and no compensation.

✅ Trip Verified |  Cabin crew were amazing, the flight from ORD to Dubai was great, the airplane was spotless, food was average, or below average but the economy seats and entertainment were above average. The flight from Dubai to Cairo was almost at equal standing, bathrooms were dirty most of the time though, the main problem that will prohibit me from recommending this airline to anyone is the experiences that I had with their ground crews in Chicago and in Dubai. Counter check-in and package drop off process overall with Emirates were the least efficient out there between the other lines that were checking in at the same time, needless to say that I spent almost 45-60 mins to finalize this step while the whole infamous TSA passport control process took less than 15 mins from start to finish on that busy day. When I finally made it to the check-in counter and I presented my Emirates compliant (not country-specific, Emirates ask for more than that) PCR test, they questioned whether or not I meet the time requirement simply because they compared the sample collection date and time in (CST) with the final destination departure time which was in Dubai local time without accounting for the time difference, after explaining that she took the test and disappeared for 10 mins before returning with the stamp of approval. Right after that she printed our 3 boarding passes for the trip to Dubai and beyond and asked to place our two carry-ons and two backpacks containing our personal items (our laptops, tablets, snacks, medicine, toys, and a change of cloth for our 4-year-old toddler) she stated that they will all be treated as carry-ons and that we were only allowed to bring two of them on board, and that if we don’t we will need to pay $200.00 in extra fees, or we can take our backpacks and check-in our carry-ons, she explained that this carry-ons restriction were a company policy imposed due to Covid, what does Covid has to do with the carry-ons and personal items allowance policy? I never had this experience ever with any other airline including my previous flights thru Emirates & Etihad, no one ever considered my laptop carrying bag as a carryon it was always listed as a personal item which I was allowed to bring on board to stow underneath my seat, I was in a state of shock and I told her that those carry-ons contained items with rechargeable batteries but that didn’t seem to sway her mind, I was in no position to argue at that point and took as much as I could from those rechargeable items form those carry-ons stuffing it into our backpacks just to follow my own safety protocols, on flight I saw many passengers boarding the airplane with their carry-ons and backpacks, and I highly doubt that they paid the $200 they wanted us to pay at the counter! Finally, the point where I completely snapped asking to see the supervisor on-site is when she-alongside another colleague of hers stated that my toddler' aviation approved child seat was not allowed inside the cabin and then they tried to charge me for an extra fourth seat claiming that to bring this on-board I’ll have to pay for an extra seat! I was like my child is 4 years old, we paid for his seat ticket of which we will place this child's seat! nothing changed their mind until the supervisor came, and I told her that we have three tickets for all 3 passengers, and she agreed with our point of view. Filed a complaint with their customer service to get a generic response.;"""approved child seat was not allowed""";"

Third: the food was not tasty at all, it was very cold. Fourth, they announce that the internet is free to use, but in reality, it needs the passenger to pay money to have it. (And hosts not supported any passenger to get free internet). Fifth, they start collecting the headset 20 minutes before the flight ending so you couldn't keep watching the movie.

Not Verified |  Their customer service is absolutely atrocious. Their website is not updated and they do not take responsibility for lacking to keep the passengers up to date with Covid travel requirements. I booked my flight two months in advance and checked the Emirates website daily in preparation for it. I am fully vaccinated but still needed a negative covid result, no problem, I got it done. When I got to the airport they said the covid result needs to be stamped. Turns out, all labs in the USA are FDA regulated and do not stamp their results for authorization. The only place that does so is inside the airport, by appointment and costs $175. I learned all of this as I was checking in for my flight. So there is obviously no time to make it and I had to miss my flight. Normally, airlines take responsibility for this and accommodate the passenger by rebooking them free of charge. Not Emirates, their reservations/customer service first said that the next flight is 11 days out, and then gave me no choice but to pay another $2000 to book a seat. I've never experienced anything like this with any airline. They are usually accommodating and not money hungry.;"""customer service is absolutely atrocious""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  I am writing this review for my dad who flew Economy from Toronto to Dubai last Saturday. He booked Emirates hoping that they provide what they promise during this pandemic (safe flights, hygienic, booking half the flight's capacity, etc) but my dad had a horrible experience. The flight was fully booked which was quite bothersome at a time when everyone around the world are practising social distancing, the faucets in both the lavatories in his proximity were overflowing and I was told that the crew had been wearing the same masks throughout the 13-14 hour flight. This is an epitome of how Emirates treats its non-premium class as the ""cattle-class"" and that basic hygiene and comfort don't really matter for those who decide to fly at a lower rate. Really ashamed at Emirates for the inequality that they show. During these unprecedented times, they must take into account the passenger's health and safety rather than looking at profits. Please provide what you promise, Emirates. Your advertisements with the cabins being sanitized and having fully vaccinated crew (who knows?) really are just for attraction, aren't they?

Our carry on bag was scaled for weight and allowed in to fly from SFO. We landed in Dubai and checked in again to start boarding. We were stopped to measure the carry on bag weight. The staff in Dubai was extreme rude , ill-mannered and disrespectful to deny the fact that the same carry on bag was allowed from origination point. Dubai staff did not allow the carry on bag with same weight. We were forced to take out almonds bag of 2 lbs and trash it which were carrying for my parents in Dubai. Our experience of flying Emirates was awful. Ba careful while flying with Emirates , they have different standards for passengers in USA and Dubai.;"""experience of flying Emirates was awful""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Booked a flight to Israel because I was told by the staff at Emirates it was good to travel and all I need was a PCR and Ministry of health document. But I actually needed 3 documents so I wasn’t allowed in Dubai .. they only asked for two documents at SFO to board the flight. They gave me a refund due to they inconvenience but took it back when I tried to fly back from Dubai to SFO for some odd reason. They said I was supposed to call and rebook the flight to go from Dubai to SfFO which I did and now they’re saying they can’t find that phone call  and they tell me just submit a complaint form.

Chauffeur service was punctual on time, Business class lounge at both DXB and CAI were spacious and clean, of course services has been adjusted due to pandemic. Check in was friendly and keeping social distancing, service on board was excellent, crew were always available and very friendly on both flights and always engaging.

Not Verified |  Flight turbulence, both ways, was terrible. The food was horribly over seasoned, the highlight being the champagne. All of that was still quite manageable. The flight back was the real fail. We picked this aircraft specifically for safety and spacing during COVID. They switched the flight the night before and left us in a bulkhead middle seat, surrounded by coughing strangers. They had an entirely empty first class section available, which they wouldn’t let us pay for or upgrade to for the flight. While speaking with customer service they were equally unhelpful. There is no service left on this airline, especially in a time where rebuilding travel and customer safety/comfort is so important.

Crew says this 'happens all the time and people are always mad'. Probably a dodgy cost save that puts people at risk.

✅ Trip Verified | This is not a premium airline anymore. The days of Emirates being a premium airline are long gone. By now their planes are old, seats and Inflight entertainment systems are broken. On the way up to Dubai 2 out of three seats has sound only in 1 ear. And one seat could not stay in position. The touch screen did not work. On the way back 1 seat and 1 sound system did not work out of three. They charge heavily for wifi and they charge significantly for a seat in front. At a rate where other airlines offer premium economy, Emirates just let you sit a couple of seats in front. European and US carriers by now have closed the gap and surpassed Emirates offering better wifi, premium economy and more innovative entertainment systems (Delta lets you watch from your own iPad). KLM flies this route with brand new 787's. But where an airline should make the real difference, Emirates fails even harder. Service. They get stuck in organizational bureaucracy. Emirates call centre gave you the wrong information? Your problem. That issue cost 200 euros? Your problem. The manager says no. Can I speak to that manager? No. Self-service check-in doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in another line of self-service machines. Still doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in the back of the line at the classic check-in counter (after spending 30 mins waiting for machines that don't work)? Can't check you in before you do a covid fast test. Go to a very badly signed fast test area. Everybody there is already checked in? Being around the self check-in Machines gives you a true to life Ryanair experience, but Ryanair actually does a better job. People with issues all over. And this is covid times, with a lot less traffic. I wonder what happens when it becomes busier.;"""This is not a premium airline anymore""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience. I paid for business class special, on the day of my departure as I was checking in my luggage, I was told my passport has a hold on for an unpaid fine, I needed to go see immigration. Having 1hr 25min left, immigration advised me it was a police hold, I was to leave the airport and go to the police station near palm Jamaeria, this meant I was missing my flight, that I just updated by paying 4K cnd on top of my original ticket extra. I arrive to the police station I was not told what the issue was for but that it was resolved i still do not know why My passport was on hold. I called the Emirates to book my new flight business flight that I paid extra for, this all happen on a Wednesday they had a flight leaving everyday to Toronto direct, but the only way I could get my business seat was if I updated it to a business flex, they would not honor this seat I paid for already, saying there is none available, They booked me in an economy class as I’m sitting on the plane right now with Extra business seats available I sit in economy. This airline is a rip off, they have the worst customer service, and all they care about is how to squeeze your money out of there customer, I recommend if you plan to take business class, don’t cancel that flight because your new flight will not be business, you will half to upgrade the seat you already paid for or go first class, be prepared to pay more money. I’m sitting in Economy, when I already for my business class seat.;"""This airline is a rip off""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Emirates lost our bag and refuse to be held liable. 7 weeks ago me and my husband boarded a direct flight from Cairo to Dubai and our bag didn't arrive that had most of our essential and valuable items, we were staying for a month. We filed a report at the airport before leaving and we were told that someone will get back to us and that we should check the bag status with a reference number. We contacted them over 20 times through phone calls/emails requesting at least a deadline to know that our luggage is officially lost so we can re-purchase the lost items. On every occasion they promised that someone would get back to us directly, of course no one ever did! Thinking emails might work but we only got vague replies stating that its still under tracing and asked us to fill a form with the value of all items in our bag and someone will get back to us with either our luggage or to compensate us, but that never happened. 49 DAYS LATER, we finally decided to file an official complaint on their website to which they responded that our bag arrived Dubai airport. Hence, they don't accept liability for it getting lost. I am very disappointed with Emirates.;"""very disappointed with Emirates""";"

✅ Trip Verified | It was a scary flight under the pandemic, flight attendants couldn't keep control of certain passengers that kept taking off their masks. Also, we had an incident where a flight attendant was blocking seats for another passenger and would not let us sit in the last row of economy to allow a young lady sleep the long 17 hour flight, and my wife was asked to change seats also to accommodate another young lady. It was reported to the supervisor and head of stewardess, it was not a good experience. Deplaning was disorderly, I have experienced how carriers do disembarking by rows and requesting passengers not to get up until their row is called, in this flight everyone was just pushing to get out, like there was no pandemic. Reported to Emirate, but it seems they did not take the complaint seriously.;"""It was a scary flight under the pandemic""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Business class was quiet with around only 20 people on board and two passengers in first class. Their product onboard still excels with many areas of a full service back on offer. The main meal is a single full tray service which for me is fine. All meals are covered by plastic lids which is a slight annoyance as there is no where to put these or they fall on the surrounding areas. But we can live with this. Drinks service was constant. I visited the onboard lounge/bar which is elegant. My only continued gripe about EK business product is that their main course meals are lacklustre, look like economy meals on a china plate and do not do the rest of the product justice. Next time perhaps I will order two starters which are always superb on EK including their signature mixed mezza.;"""full service back on offer""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I have been bought to fly to Dar es Salaam via Dubai but the connection flight was cancelled. Emirates contacted me and was very apologetic – offering a change to the subsequent day. Unfortunately, I had to be in Tanzania on that day and so it is not convenient. Emirates then  offered either to keep the ticket open, for me to book again over the next two years or receive a full refund. I opted for the refund and within two days the full amount had been credited back to my credit card. Over the past few months, I have had to cancel a number of flights and have battled with airlines to get refunds. It is often been difficult even to speak to the airlines and on one occasion I have obtained a refund through my credit card company. Emirates response has been exemplary – they were proactive, pleasant and acted immediately and it is one which other airlines should follow if they are going to stand any chance of restoring their fortunes.

✅ Trip Verified |  As an airline enthusiast, I chose Etihad in order to experience a new gulf state carrier. I had high expectations, having immensely enjoyed earlier flights with Emirates and Qatar. While not a flawless experience, my flights with Etihad confirmed their reputation. The check-in experience in Bangkok was a little contentious, as the agent insisted that my tennis racket needed to travel as checked luggage. This was a new experience after fifty years of air travel. The Miracle lounges that Etihad uses at BKK are satisfactory but unexceptional. I would say the same for the Etihad lounge in Abu Dhabi. The cabin was neat and clean, the seats comfortable, and the amenity kit full of useful and aromatic products. Pre-departure champagne (or a Bellini ) was served in a flute, and the cabin crew out of Bangkok were warm and welcoming. The crew from Abu Dhabi to Milan were somewhat more subdued, but given the 02:45 departure time, so was I. I want to particularly commend the purser on my flight EY 407 from BKK. She was helpful, kind, and engaging and her efforts moved this experience into one of my most positively memorable flights. The mechanics of the flights - departure, arrival, luggage delivery, etc. were all on punctual.;"""cabin was neat and clean, the seats comfortable""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Overall as expected from a 4 star full-service carrier. The luggage allowance of 30kg for discount economy flyers proved more generous than expected as my two pieces of baggage totalled up to about 32kgs, yet the gate agent still didn't raise any issues or charge me any additional luggage fees. As expected the 777s within Etihad's fleet are somewhat dated interior wise, where since the particular aircraft (first flight in 2012 after looking up its registration) took its maiden flight it is most likely the interior has not been renovated since. This doesn't prevent the crew from still delivering on a somewhat pleasant 14 hour flight tho, with 2 full meals and snacks in between. The only downside is the lack of a self-service snack bar in the galley of the aircraft, which made finding a quick bite, or even trying to grab some water after sleeping particularly difficult. With all that in mind and considering the relatively affordable price point, makes the flight still one worth recommending.;"""somewhat pleasant 14 hour""";"

"Not Verified |  I flew from Dublin to Sydney recently and the second leg of my trip was terrible. The plane for this leg for archaic with narrow seats, horrible leg space, and a tiny entertainment screen. The TV froze 1 minute into my 14 hour flight. I said this to the cabin crew straight away but was ignored until I asked for a 5th time almost 3 hours into the flight. In the end, they couldn't fix it, they claimed they couldn't move me as the plane was full, and offer me a $15 wifi voucher as compensation. Firstly, the wifi voucher only last 6 hours maximum, but in reality it doesn't even last that long. The staff member informed me that the data limit was low and so I couldn't watch videos on it, and this wasn't useful to me at all. The most disappointing part, however, is Etihad's indifference and poor service after the fact by refusing to do anything for me as ""they already gave me a wifi voucher as a service recovery.""

We had three large suitcases and guess how much Etihad wanted to charge us during online check in - 600 euros per bag. For me that was shocking. Would I recommend it?

✅ Trip Verified |  It's cheaper than emirates, but by no means cheap. All the planes are quite dated. If I had paid for business, I'd want my money back. The food on our November flight here was the worst food I've ever had on an airline. Inedible. The trip from Istanbul, where the Turkish people have much pride, was excellent. From Syd to Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi to Athens, foul. I have always found the cabin crew to be polite, so no dramas there. The worst experience is T3 Abu Dhabi. It has got to be the worst airport I've ever had the displeasure of using. T3 is dedicated to Etihad and the facilities are so substandard. One toilet block for multiple gates with few toilets. Also downstairs so a big hassle. Then the security - you pass through the usual security, buy some water on way to gate, and then it is confiscated at the actual hate. WTF!. Then you have to sit in gate and wait with no access to water. Why not put the vending machine inside the gate? And what's the point of security if the check is disregarded and you have to be checked all over again at the gate. Only airline and airport this has ever happened to me. This experience is likely a reason I will pay extra and fly Emirates next time.;"""worst experience is T3 Abu Dhabi"" ";"

✅ Trip Verified |  A flight attendant was bringing a drink and snack down the aisle. A passenger in an opposite backwards seat to me got up, crashed into her by accident, causing the drink and food to go flying into my seat which I was asleep in. Luckily the liquid was not hot. It went over my phone, charger and book and my blanket. My phone came up with an error message saying liquid had got into it, the charger fizzled out and my book was ruined. One of the crew took my phone into the galley and dried it out. I agree it was an accident but the report was written on a napkin. I was advised someone from “customer care” would contact me. They didn’t. A few days later I went on “live chat” they said log a complaint. The complaint was supposedly investigated but the response I received was inaccurate in the extreme. When I tried to follow up, I was ignored. I logged a further complaint only to be tersely told that if anything was damaged I should make an insurance claim and that the case was closed.(This took 3.5 months.

✅ Trip Verified |  The whole experience was like flying with a low cost airline. Very little space, really low level of comfort. And on top of everything useless staff. The person in front of me reclined his seat and even in such a limited space that I had it wasn't a problem for me. But it was a long flight and the person in front of me didn't put his seat back during a meal service. I asked a cabin crew member to ask him to put his seat back just that i can eat for a few minutes. She asked him to slightly slightly put his seat up and he didn't really do anything. I showed her that i can't put anything on my tray in this position (i couldn't put my tray down because the seat was too low and it was impossible to put anything between that seat and my legs) so she just had some strange look on her face like sorry but I don't care and left. So for the whole trip i wasn't be able to eat. In normal airplanes it's a must to have all seats in upright position for takeoff, landing and meal service. When the next meal was served I showed her again that I'm not able to put anything on my tray and she offered me to change my paid window seat next to my husband and go on some middle seat on the back - because she couldn't ask a customer in front of me to put his seat back for only 10 minutes.;"""on top of everything useless staff""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  What a terrible experience for a ""world class airline"". It started with the stupid decision of thinking the airline actually cares about you paying money to reserve your seats in advance - they don't. We paid to reserve window seats together only to get on the plane and realize our seats were reassigned and we were given middle centre seats. Luckily, we had a member of the cabin crew who helped us sit in the front row which brings me to the friendliness of their staff but that's pretty much the only good thing about this airline. On our way back from London, we decided to pay $220 to upgrade to Premium Economy. Payment went through, got the message from my bank that the amount was debited and the confirmation page came up. All good, right? The next day when it was time for online check in, they bumped us to the back of the plane. In a panic seeing as our seats were gone and there was only one pair of seats together that was remaining, I paid another $220 to book them and got the confirmation email from the airline as well as the message from the bank. Called customer service, I had to explain it to the agent about 5 or 6 times until he understood the issue. He said he forwarded it to the refund department and they will call me in an hour. You can maybe guess whether or not they actually called. Got to the airport with our boarding passes only for the check-in employee to tell us that somehow I'm not checked in and he's unable to do it. He had to call the supervisor to override it. We had a 1h20m transit in Abu Dhabi so it was going to be tight, but of course our flight left an hour late and we arrived with only 40 mins to our next flight. Unfortunately we had to run the entire distance of the airport given the arriving flight and departing flight were on opposite ends of the airport. Finally the trip was over and we made it back to Oman safely yesterday. I woke up this morning to see a message from my bank that Etihad charged me a third time for the seats. So for an upgrade that should have cost $220, I ended up paying $660 so far. Got on the phone just now and the agent tells me ""this happens and it should come back in your account within 15 days, we'll call you then to check.""

✅ Trip Verified |  I recently flew to Abu Dhabi to compete in the World Triathlon Finals with my $7000 triathlon bicycle and gear in a separate bike box. Etihad lost my bicycle box in two airports: Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi. My bike & gear arrived 5 days late so I couldn't use it for the race. This ruined my opportunity to successfully compete for Team Canada at the World Triathlon Championships that I qualified and trained years for. This was devastating for me, as it would be for any athlete. I had to go to the airport in Abu Dhabi to find my bike box - I wasn't given any notification from Etihad staff that it was on the plane or that it had arrived. Etihad staff walked me all around the airport, bringing me to random corners to ask if different boxes looked like my bike. Anyone could have walked out with my bike if they had left it in the hallways they showed me. When I filed a complaint, Etihad offered me $50 US for the inconvenience, but their webpage was broken so I couldn't get the money. When I emailed their staff for help to receive the funds, their baggage assistance staff closed my customer complaint account! So I received no compensation for the delayed bike box and the huge stress this caused me. Secondly, the Etihad staff at the Frankfurt gate at first told me I missed my flight even though the plane was sitting there. They finally let me on after 20min of talking amongst themselves. When I walked on to the plane, someone was in my seat. I stood in the plane for about 15min while Etihad staff unsuccessfully addressed the man in my seat who wouldn't budge. So I had to sit in his seat in order to sit somewhere. I would highly recommend never flying with Etihad - the incompetence and unhelpfulness of the baggage, airport, airline, and customer complaint staff was absolutely astounding.;"""recommend never flying with Etihad""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  One of my worst encounters with an airline. I found 2 damaged luggage after taking Etihad Airways flights from Paris to Abu Dhabi to Singapore on 30 Nov 2022. Since then, it has been a nightmare filing my claim with them. You will understand when you go through the entire process on their website. It has been more than 5 weeks, I really don't understand why they make it so difficult for their customers, as if to discourage us from doing so. There is no sense of customer service at all. To my horror, the baggage claim officer wrote to say he has closed my case, even after I have provided all the photos and forms. Etihad Airways can keep the measly compensation offer of US$100.

Literally every sit packed, people playing videos and TikTok’s on high volume. Staff chit chatting all flight with each other instead of serving customers. Not once has anyone asked whether everything was fine or I needed anything. The chitchat was so loud I had trouble sleeping. I had to ask the staff to keep it quiet, a request that they completely ignored, all for the 3500€ ticket price! As if this wasn’t enough, the “epitome” of the flight was at the end. The business class toilet was occupied for a long time, when the door opened, a flight attendant came out. I rushed in to brush my teeth and discovered a think air of electronic cigarette smoke (you cannot confuse this smell with anything!). So apart from customer negligence, poor service and low value for the money, this airline’s own employees are breaking the law and international flight regulations. ;"""Flight attendants outright rude""";"

"Not Verified |  The first flight from Moscow to Bangkok was ok, but the service on the plane, the food and the general condition of the plane did not match the cost of the flight. I encountered a rather nasty attitude from the flight attendants when I asked about food options, got the answer ""we are not a restaurant"". The airport in Abu Dhabi is very inconvenient, outdated and stuffy, it is difficult to deal with transfers. But the most unpleasant thing happened during the return flight. Due to connection problems, I was 10 minutes late for check-in, so I called the office to warn and ask to wait. Absolutely all the airlines that I flew before agreed to help, even if I was late for 20 minutes. As a result, I faced not only a refusal to help, but also received boorish claims in my address that I was an irresponsible passenger and no one should go towards me like me. In addition to the completely unsatisfactory quality of the language of the representative of the company, she behaved very rudely towards me. I may be irresponsible, but I think that a major airline has no right to treat their customers like this. Especially for the price Etihad charges for their services. If you don't want to assist your clients, at least do it politely. I came to the check-in desk exactly 6 minutes late, the airline staff were no longer there. If you do not want to experience such an attitude towards yourself, I recommend choosing another airline, since now there is a large choice, even among Arab airlines. The service, food and aircraft condition of Etihad is also the worst of Arab airlines.";"""I recommend choosing another airline""";"

Not Verified |  I was very disappointed and uncomfortable with how Etihad Airways was treating me on a 6 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Brussels on December 15th. This was one of the worst overnight flights I have ever experienced in Economy Class. The inflight entertainment system was very poor and was glitching, I expected the flight to be good but it was horrible! The flight was disappointing, the airline needs to upgrade their services. Next time I will never choose Etihad Airways for travel!;"""flight was disappointing""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  It was mentioned on Etihad Airways that they will provide accomodation for stop-over of more than 10 hours. My stop-over was around 23 hrs but Etihad said they dont have any rooms left. They did not provide me any room for stop-over and said no rooms available for your dates. I was trying to book room about 4 months ago. I booked the room in Abu Dhabi Airport Hotel and interestingly it was the same hotel Etihad Airways told me that there are no rooms left. They lied to me. I dont recommend to travel with Etihad if you have stop-over of more than 2-3 hours.;"""did not provide me any room for stop-over""";"

After several weeks was asked for proof of purchase (Which I had already provided). Had to resubmit all previous documents as well as the receipt. Then told that no compensation would be given for baggage over 5 years old. So, if your bag is more than 5 years old they can smash a wheel off it and deny liability. Rubbish customer care (although they were grateful for giving them the opportunity to review my case. They look forward to welcoming me back on board - I think not.

The worst person was the duty manager who even mocked at my wife who was a wheelchair patient. The lounge was outsourced as well and was a pathetic dump. Luckily I had a priority pass and could use other lounges. Boarding started on time and the flight was packed in every seta. The plane was dated but the service was overall very good by the Etihad crew. IFE was not bad and the food quality was very nice. Wifi packages were reasonable and I was able to buy it using my miles. The best part was that we landed 50 minutes ahead of schedule which was wonderful!;"""airport experience was one of the worst""";"

✅ Trip Verified | My sister and I flew from Singapore to Manchester. Although the booking was made through lastminute.com I chose my return seats direct with Etihad. I paid for them and both on row 44 yet when I got on the plane someone was sat in my seats and refused to move. When I looked at my boarding card I’d been given different seats to the ones I’d pre booked. I was very unhappy with this confusion and it would definitely put me off booking with Etihad again. Please see below. What’s worse is no one from the airline cares at all that they’ve stolen my money. No one has replied to the 6 emails I’ve sent. It’s £45 ! I don’t care about the money it’s just disgusting, arrogant and theft. I flew 7 weeks ago now. I will always look to fly with other airlines form now on.

Which I tried failed as their website not allowed. 3 -4 hrs before 2nd check in at Abu Dhabi airport got mail saying there is issue with charging me for my upgrade bid. Which I fixed and they charged my card. Then drama started. Not getting confirmation, approached transfer desk 3 times they said call call center. Called them being told connect to transfer desk. After ping pong finally able grab call centre they said checking with other team what is happening. Same happened with 3 consultants 3 times by the time after 10-15 call got disconnected. Tried to chat they said wait for confirmation mail. Boarding started, flight about close in 20 min, called again 4 time was told call back to check status in 10 min. Called again 5th tome after 10 min just before flight close , was finally for answer we its system error they sent email and charged my card , though business seats available, i got error mail saying my bid success wrong charge. Traveling with my daughter and anguish they caused both of us. After 14 hr flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi and 14 hr layover at airport, not even proper seating available and paid lounge fully booked. They supposed to provide hotel for long gap, was told rudely at Sydney airport they dont provide hotel as it was my choice to take later flight with 14 hr layover.

✅ Trip Verified |  Me and my wife booked a flight from Melbourne to Greece with Etihad for November 11, 2022. After spending several hours in the plane, the flight was finally cancelled and at 3AM they told us to look for a hotel ourselves, something we did. The next day we went to the Etihad desk at Melbourne airport and they told us that we will get reimbursed for our hotel expenses (two tickets stayed in one room). They told us to submit the papers through their website. One the 12th we flew to Greece with Emirates and arrived on the 13th. I have been trying to find the forms and the site to submit the necessary paperwork but after two days I was not able to discover anything. Today I called their customer service in Greece and in Emirate and the amazing answer they gave me is that they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi! I told them this was not fair since I am not asking any compensation for the over 24-hour delay involving two passengers but only to pay for my hotel. The answer was still the same no compensation for hotels outside Abu Dhabi. Conclusion: Etihad lied to me in Melbourne about hotel compensation. They did absolutely nothing for the long delay. While waiting in the airplane for several hours they offered us water and some salty pretzels. Completely unacceptable.;"""they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Geneva in First on a 787-9. Probably the best flight I had. Crew was outstanding, formal and professional, yet engaging with passengers. The seat is stunning, very roomy, elegant, and does not feel claustrophobic. Food was extremely good: the menu is not that extensive but the quality of every dish is very high. You can order anything from the onboard menu, at any time. Pajamas provided are designed by a local Emirati brand A Friend Of Mine: drawing inspiration from traditional Emirati dress, I found these pajamas to be incredibly soft and comfortable. Amenity kit is stocked with Acqua di Parma products. In my opinion, this First class product is much better than Emirates First. Some areas of improvement: no amenities are offered in the toilet; WiFi quality and speed could be better (First passengers are given 200MB for free); champagne could be enhanced (Etihad serves Charles Heidsieck 2006, both Brut and Rosé, while Singapore Airlines, e.g., serves Krug in First). Other than that, a flight close to perfection. The First Class Lounge & SPA at Abu Dhabi airport is beautifully designed and worth spending at least 2 hours.";"""product is much better than Emirates First""";"

I ordered a low-calorie meal which was ok, but too much plastic is being used (starting from the cutlery). Some crew members looked annoyed by passenger requests.

✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly from ORD to Abu Dhabi (22nd Oct) and Abu Dhabi to KTM (24th Oct). 4 days before the flight, they canceled my connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to KTM. They offered me a 23rd Oct flight ticket but I had to reach Ktm by 24th Oct so I asked them to prepone flight instead of postponing. Though it was totally their fault to cancel the flight at the last hour, they asked me to pay 487 dollar extra for my rescheduled flight. After spending 1 and half hour pleasing them, they deducted 200 dollar and offered me reschedule by paying 287 extra. It is very inconvenient to cancel a flight at the last hour and make customers pay extra for the flight. It was their responsibility to offer a convenient reschedule flight option to customers free of charge when they are canceling a flight. Very disappointed.;"""Very disappointed""";"

At JFK I had to wait for the Etihad counters to open for more than an hour, once the counter is open they asked us to move to a line and had us wait for 40 mins to start/open the counters. I had to wait just to collect the boarding pass because I couldn’t get them from online. When I reached the counter they charged me 60$ as I am carrying a backpack for my laptops.

When we got the airport check in was smooth however we had booked a bulkhead seats for all flights for my dads 50th but since they changed the plane from a 787-9 to a 777-300 meaning that we couldn't access the bulkheads seats and the Etihad staff were rude and refused to give a refund and we had to pay more for fees. The plane was older than expected, Inflight entertainment screens were tricky and average quality and it was showing its age. food on both flights were bland and repetitive meat rice and veggies but they offered drinks consistently, The layover in Abu Dhabi was terrible and lines were long the second leg from Abu Dhabi to Rome the 787 was better and easier to sleep in.

✅ Trip Verified |  The leg from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Melbourne was the worst flight of my life, both ways. I've flown the route from Melbourne to Vienna many times with Emirates, Qatar, Qantas, this was hands down the worst experience by far. Not only was the plane for this 13 hour flight 20+ years old, the seats were unbelievably uncomfortable, the bathrooms were filthy, on the first flight the toilet flushing button was smashed and covered in filth. The food was awful. On returning home, I looked to see if I could book a premium economy seat to alleviate the discomfort. The website told me the seats I selected were unavailable, but charged me 222.00 $ each time I clicked a seat. I was charged multiple times for seats that were unavailable. I immediately called Etihad and asked them to refund me. I was told I wasn't charged and my bank would release the funds in 24 hours. On the flight in question I was given one of the worst seats, in the very back of the plane in a seat that didn't recline. 5 days later, the money still isn't back in my account. I call again and say I'm going to dispute with my bank, they ask for 24 more hours to reverse the charge. It's been three days, a total of over a week. They're still keeping my money.;"""money still isn't back in my account""";"

After months of chasing them to say the website is showing an error (invalid PNR - even though ticket was issued and confirmed), they completely ignored my emails, made me run around, kept buying time, eventually telling me I had to book after I completed my first leg (which I did). and when I arrived at the airport and said I have been trying for months, they acknowledged that I had in fact talked to them but still proceeded to refuse me a hotel. I had to end up paying from my pocket and all this time that I spent chasing them up was completely wasted. I asked if there is an office or desk in the airport where I can lodge a complaint, they said there's none! Terrible service, will not fly with them again.;"""will not fly with them again""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and myself were on a flight from Melbourne to Athens via Abu Dhabi. At first the flight was delayed slightly, according to the captain to wait on a couple of last minute passengers, which I understand. 15 minutes later, he announced again that we were going to be a little more due to some cargo taking longer than usual to load. When we finally took off, it was a little over an hour after the initial flight time. Once we were in the air, i decided to plug in the earphones provided to watch a movie but the plug wasn't working properly so i plugged in my double adapter to use my own headphones. Once again, it didn't work properly, I could barely hear anything and when there was sound it was distorted, and the contrast on the screen even after adjustment was horrible to the point where i gave up and opened my tablet instead. About 4 hours before landing breakfast was being served, and I was asked what i would like to drink and i said orange juice. When the stewardess was putting the tray down, she knocked over the cup of juice all over my lap which ended up running down my leg, into my socks and shoes. She finished serving breakfast and 15 minutes later she came to me with wet wipes after i had already cleaned up all the mess. After waiting about half hour without anyone coming to see if i needed anything, i kept ringing my bell for someone to come, only for that light to keep getting put out. When someone finally did come and i explained my situation, he responded with ""What do you want me to do about it?"". Not only did no one offer to look for a change of pants, but wasn't even offered to be moved to another seat, or even just putting a towel or something over the seat so i didn't have to sit on an orange juiced soaked seat. This was the worst flight experience I have had with any airline.  Our flight home back to Melbourne is with Etihad and we hope that that trip is a better experience that the initial one. In our minds, we thought that Etihad had a decent level of standards compared to some other airlines, but our experience showed otherwise, and perhaps our flight home can make up for the bad experience that we had.";"""worst flight experience I have had""";"

I have explained it to at least 3 people, and the response is always, we'll get back to you. This is not a case of refunding. This is simply a case of a cancelled booking, where the money was refunded then taken again. I didn't make another booking, I didn't use the ticket and I certainly did raise a complaint and explained it in detail. What does Etihad do - nothing. They hire multiple different partners it seems, each from a different region and they are impossible to connect you with someone from actual headquarters.

Come time to return from London and at the airport, the customer service assistant tells me “there might not be a seat for me”. I ask her to clarify as I have family in London and would rather stay there than in Abu Dhabi as I am alone. She doesn’t respond and I make it on the plane. Confusing woman. None the less I got on the plane and arrive in Abu Dhabi, wait at the gate for 3 hours for my connecting flight, and within the final 5 minutes they tell me I am unable to board the flight as it was over booked. The horrible man at customer service offered me a ticket TWO DAYS LATER. I vehemently denied this. Next flight was 14 hours later with a stop off to Melbourne. I’ve missed the entire day of work. You cannot be serious that a long haul flight over books. That’s just atrocious and money hungry - shame on this airline. Never before experienced such hideous, appalling customer service or lack of accountability from a company. Not a sorry in sight and all of their workers seem to act as if it is their first day - no one has a clue what they are doing. It’s the strangest experience. They gave me a voucher for a meal which could only be used at Burger King or a random Curry House which understandably doesn’t seem appealing before travelling for 14 hours. The voucher didn’t even buy a coffee. What on earth! They also gave me a $300 USD voucher for my troubles. Went in the trash straight away.

Our original flight was booked during COVID from Kuala Lumpur back to Istanbul, where we were living. They canceled the flight within 24 hours of booking, and would only issue a travel credit. They were intentionally keeping bookings open for flight routes that they were canceling to collect airfares and turn them into travel credits. Horrible customer service. Avoid at all costs.

I phoned again during the day and waited on hold so long that our transport arrived to take us to the airport for the original timed flight so we then had to wait at the airport for 6 hours (not 3). Etihad staff at the airport told us that all connecting flights would be delayed for all passengers so we would not miss our connecting flights. However we received an updated itinerary stating our connecting flight would depart 9 minutes before we were due to arrive in Abu Dhabi (even I know no one can go backwards in time).  We arrived in Abu Dhabi ahead of schedule and ran (we are 60 years old) to the connecting flight's gate showing Last Call (after pushing our way through security) to be told that our baggage had been offloaded which is impossible because our plane had only reached the arrival gate 12 minutes before and there were 400+ passengers with luggage so how could our luggage be singled out and transferred to the connecting flight's aircraft and then offloaded in 12 minutes?  We stood in line at the Departure/Arrival Transfer desk for 2 hours (I had to ask Etihad staff to bring water for the 100+ passengers waiting as it was 30+ oC in the building) and we were given a voucher for a 5 star hotel for my 60th Birthday but Etihad had not checked vacancies so after reaching the downstairs Transfer desk, we were told the 5 star hotel had no spare rooms so we waited 1 more hour to be transferred to the Ibis hotel. As our final destination did not require PCR tests, we had not been PCR tested (we had used Rapid Antigen tests at home and were COVID negative) so we had to stay in our hotel room and not use any hotel facilities. We had slept through lunch (after arriving in Abu Dhabi at 2.20am but not reaching the hotel until 7am) and had to eat a salad and fruit instead of a proper meal. I even asked for ice-cream and was told I had to pay. (We spoke to other passengers after their stay in Abu Dhabi who were not restricted from using their Hotel's restaurants and facilities. So why were we restricted to our rooms?).  Etihad (on Facebook Messenger) had told me that the hotel Concierge would have to contact Etihad to arrange transfer back to the airport 3 hours before the connecting flight but the hotel Concierge phoned many times and Etihad never answered the phone (the phone was busy or did not connect). After waiting and waiting until there was only 2.5 hours before departure I paid for 7 people to travel in taxis back to the airport.  I had been in contact with Etihad Support using Facebook Messenger and received consoling messages but absolutely zero/no action. I was told to wait and there would be action but there was no action at all.;"""consoling messages but absolutely zero/no action""";"

Not Verified |  What started off as a much awaited business- cum -pleasure trip to the UK (Manchester) from Malaysia (KL)for my wife and I and our kids was going well and fine till our return leg from Manchester to Abu Dhabi where my wife had problems lifting her hand carry luggage to the overhead cabin and requested for cabin crew assistance to which one of them agreed to. My wife was on one side of the aisle in business class while I was beside her on the other side separated by a barrier and so couldn't help her. Incidentally, both of us are elderly in our mid 60's and she had just had a Left knee joint replacement surgery done barely 2 months ago. Before the cabin crew came to help, the cabin flight manager came and she ordered me to put the bags up for my wife without asking about our health problems. When I tried to explain, she asked to go around to the other side of the aisle to do it and walked away. I didn't have time to do it as we were about to take off but a cabin crew came and helped without any fuss. Immediately after the plane took off and started cruising, this unpleasant lady cabin manager came, introduced herself and sternly told me care of our hand luggage is our sole personal responsibility and not the duty of any of her crew to help! Despite my explaining, she was unapologetic, unhelpful and unhappy. She certainly spoiled my day and made me lose any respect for the airline. Her rudeness, unprofessional behaviour embarassed me in front of my family and the other passengers.;"""she was unapologetic, unhelpful and unhappy""";"

The airport staff from Etihad Airways are the worst i have ever seen. Inside the flight they refuse to provide hot water to feed the milk to children (we need to beg them for hot water 2 to 3 times), if the child cries they will ask you to take them to Restroom for calming.

✅ Trip Verified |  I, along with my wife and three small children were supposed to fly on flight EY66 / EY430 from Moscow to Bangkok. When checking in our luggage, the airline representative refused to check us in for the flight and demanded that we provide Thaipass. I was not informed that this could be a reason for denial of registration. However, I applied for a Thaipass at the time of check-in, and begged the airline representative to delay check-in from 10.55 am to 11.15 am, with the flight scheduled to depart at 11.55 am. Sheremetyevo airport is not busy. Despite my requests, the representative of the airline finished check-in and left the airport at 11.00. at 11.15 am I received a letter saying that all members of my family received a Thaipass, which allowed me to fly to Thailand. I contacted the Etihad representative by phone and asked to find a way to get on the flight, given that I went through online check-in in advance. All my requests were answered in the negative. In addition, our return tickets were automatically cancelled. In addition to air tickets, I paid for hotel accommodation in Thailand, and a lot of related expenses. It is impossible to describe the state of my family, given the lack of opportunities to change or buy new tickets.;"""demanded that we provide Thaipass""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible service for those who want to fly with pets in cabin. You cannot plan a trip with this company as the department does not give you answer for ages (btw I called either local cc in Russia and international one in UAE). The calls to support center does not give you anything because they can only verify if there is room for your pet or no. They can only write a letter to this pet department! First time I called the international department, they wrote this letter and said that the dept should answer in 24 hours but we didn't get any answer! Same story with my local department. And all the time when all this happened, I couldn't be sure in my future plans as they do not book this place for your pet. By the way, people in support center are polite and ok in terms of their professional capabilities. All in all I strongly recommend not to use this company for your flights with pets as you cannot be sure in your future plans.;"""not to use this company for flights with pets""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Kochi via Abu Dhabi. It was an nightmare of an experience. The flight was about 2-3 hours delay and we missed the connecting flight. We were provided with tickets only on next day, We were given a cheap food voucher they took our passports for visa processing since the hotel was outside the airport. Even though we called earlier and confirmed that the hotel reservation will be provided inside the airport. They initially said it will take an hour or 2 but we had to wait with kids for more than 5 hours in cold uncomfortable chairs in the middle of the night around 2.00 am to get the visa for the hotel transfer. We asked them to let us in a lounge but they said it cannot be provided as per policy. Such rude attitude and behavior shown by the staff even after mentioning we had small kids. We have never had such a horrendous experience any time during our flight journey in our entire lives. My best advice is to never ever travel with this airlines.;"""nightmare of an experience""";"

Not Verified |  I want to make a serious complaint about the terrible lack of customer service at Etihad, for those flying with pets. Etihad is the only airline allowing pet in cabin in and outbound into UAE. However the service responsible for that does not have a phone and only communicates very sporadically and very vaguely by email. Calling the call centre is useless as these people just keep saying it is not their department. So we are facing strict deadlines with complex documents to submit, but no timely feedback from Etihad. Basically no feedback at all. I had to change my flight several times because of this and I am desperate, it feels like I will never get on this flight and I have sleepless nights. One phone call from the right department could have fixed all this. But now I am making endless calls to call center in the hope if could move something. ;"""I am making endless calls to call center""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Munich to Abu Dhabi. Flew to Abu Dhabi on the comfortable Business Studio product of Etihad. Always loved the hard product onboard and seeing that the soft product onboard has steadily improved over the past years makes me very happy. Upon entering the Dreamliner, I found the Wellness Kit onboard that features a few Covid related safety measurements, such as hand sanitisers and a mask. They also had the luxurious Acqua di Parma amenity kit ready as I took my seat, which is my all-time favorite Business Class amenity kit. The catering onboard was delicious with a choice of starters, mains and desserts and the all-day menu featuring a nice range of further meals. Crew was super attentive, remembered my preferences and ensured my well-being throughout the entire 6 hours flight from Munich to Abu Dhabi. It's nice to see Etihad back at their high service level.

✅ Trip Verified |  I was tested Covid positive at Bengaluru Airport labs (Auriga Research) and could not board the airline as a result. This was just a few hours from the departure of the flight to Toronto. This was on January 29th, 2022. I informed this to Etihad along with my passport and covid positive report details and was cooperative with them throughout the process. Since I could not board the flight due to being tested covid positive, I was subsequently asked to submit my passport information, report result, credit card used for the booking and the credit card statement multiple times to Etihad. I have been following up numerous times with the call centre at Etihad Refund department and all they say is wait for 45 days. It has been close to 120 days now, also their twitter help was useless as they too like the call centre employees ask me to wait for 45 days. They keep giving a random date on which the refund processing has started and ask me to wait for 45 days from that date - sometimes 45 business days, sometimes its 45 calendar days. This is just a delay tactic in the hope that I eventually give up. I have spent approximately 2300 CAD and used about 1800 CAD approximately through a travel bank. This is a large amount I paid for a one way trip but due to circumstances beyond my control I was unable to board the flight, how am I supposed to let go of such a large amount? Every time they ell me it is in processing and submitting a formal complaint on their website does not yield any results. I am really anxious now and look for some light at the end of the tunnel in the form of a refund. ;"""This is just a delay tactic""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Let me start by never recommending Etihad Airlines to anyone. I'm a student in Germany so I travel a lot back and forth between Germany and the Emirates, 3-4 times yearly. Every single flight that I have taken with Etihad has had some delay, issue, unprofessionalism, rudeness, and inexperience from their staff. Every time I travel they stop me at the counters and check my residency card for at least an hour, making me catch the flight literally in the last minutes before takeoff. One could argue that it's a standard procedure, but seriously it takes you an hour to verify an ID card rightfully issued by German authorities? Another thing that always happens is delays. The amount of delays that you experience with Etihad is unimaginable. Out of around 12 flights with them, at least 11 flights were delayed by 1-2 hours. Again, this wasn't a major issue for me because I usually choose holidays or weekends when traveling so it doesn't hurt my schedule a lot. However, this one time I had a flight from Hamburg (Germany) to Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) with a connecting flight in Frankfurt booked through their official website. The first flight Hamburg to Frankfurt was delayed by one hour for technical reasons. However, the second flight from Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi was on time. You guessed it right, the first flight landed as my second flight was taking off. I called them and explained the situation several times after being transferred from one operator to another and the reply I got was (We'll book you the next flight tomorrow, and fortunately for you we will not charge you). Originally, my flight was on a Sunday at 2pm, now the new flight is on Monday 2pm. I called them and explained again my situation and demanded a compensation cause I'll be missing a full working day and also would need a place to stay to wait for my next flight and the operator said that I could file a compensation claim on their website with a receipt of the hotel and would be compensated accordingly. However, when I did that I was stuck with calling Etihad back and forth for at least a month before giving up. They blamed the connecting flight airlines for the delay, and when I explained that I booked my ticket through their website and that I do not have to do with what airline‘s fault was it as long as they‘re the ones that received the money, then they should solve such an incident and compensate me on that delay. Of course I didn‘t get a single penny from them, didn‘t even get an apology and was treated as if it was my fault for not catching the flight. All in all, a really horrible company, they treat their customers as if our flights are free and we didn't pay anything, no respect, no professionalism, literally nothing. I personally would travel the world on a bike if they were the only option.;"""Every single flight has had some delay""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I fly to India a few times per year. I fly Economy and have flown with any and every airline. I was lured in by a great deal on a return flight to Mumbai. The catch was an extra stopover in Manchester. My bag was left in Manchester. It did not arrive in Mumbai. I missed my connecting flight to Goa. My bag took 5 days to recover. Daily contact with Etihad from my husband and from me by phone and email. In the end, the bag arrived - no apology, no notice. The flights I took were okay. Food is okay. Service is mostly rude and uninterested. One nice cabin crew member and the man who took my lost bag details was a great help. No air corridors. Busses to terminals. Rubbish website. No customer service. I've no doubt necessity will ensure I will fly with them again but make no mistake this is a budget airline pretending to be fancy.

Scheduled Abu Dhabi - Dubai coaches don't turn up, and you'll be left abandoned for hours in a carpark with no information or alternative transport. -No Etihad representatives present upon arrival, desk closed.  Customer 'support' based on a drawn out system of misdirection and lies clearly designed to wear customers down and staff will claim ‘no authority’ to resolve anything. No response to submitting issues through their online system, don’t bother. Instructed by online departments to complain via phone and vice versa in an endless circle.  I was continuously promised compensation and resolutions that were later denied on several occasions. Customer support staff refuse to provide anything in writing. On the following call, (that you will have to make when they don’t call/email back as promised), they deny everything you have previously agreed.  I eventually spoke with a supervisor who told me he would personally call back within four hours, he did not, and then told his staff to pretend he had left the office when I called back, though it was clearly apparent that he was still there.  I will never be travelling with them again on principle of their total lack of morals, respect, and basic decency.;"""I will never be travelling with them again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew in business class on Etihad to Amsterdam in April 2022. It was my first time flying with Etihad and it was an overnight flight with a stopover in Abu Dhabi. The first leg of the journey started off with dinner service. Etihad has a dine as you please policy in business class and I chose to have dinner immediately after take off. For starter I had the Arabic mezze and for the main I had prawn briyani. Both were tasty and full of flavour. The staff were attentive and the cabin manager introduced himself to business class passengers. The second leg of the journey departed AUH in the early hours of the morning. As it was too early to have breakfast, I requested for breakfast to be served 2 hours prior to arrival in Amsterdam. For breakfast I had the yoghurt with granola and the Arabic option. The hard product of the business class section is comfortable. The seating is arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration with even seats facing forward and odd number seats facing backwards. I chose the window seat facing forward. It had 2 windows of view. The tray table was large and heavy and provided good support. The seat was fully reclining and there was adequate space in the footwell for you to sleep straight. Do note that if you are sitting in the window seat and your seat is in the lounging position, you will need to use the pillow as an arm rest for the other arm. Storage space was adequate. Besides the overhead lockers, you have a side bin to store your accessories like cellphones etc. There was a touch screen controller from which you could select your entertainment options. The selection of Western movies was somewhat limited. The classical music channel was also limited. Wifi was available on board but it is on a paid basis but I did not avail myself of it. The amenity kit was by Acqua Parma and it contained a toothbrush, eyeshade, snood to cover your mouth and nose, and a bottle of cologne. A separate hygiene kit was provided which contained a surgical mask, hand sanitizer and wet wipes. Overall, I had a good experience on Etihad. The airfares were very reasonable considering that this is almost near the peak travel season after travel was severely impacted by the COVID19 pandemic. I would definitely fly with Etihad on business class again.;"""I had a good experience on Etihad""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  This was the worst flight I experienced by far. The flight had about 3-4 hours delay while at first we were told its about 30 mins to one hour! We and many other customers lost our connecting flight. And were offered next day flights. We were given a cheap food voucher with only one bottle of water or tea to choose from! In addition, they took our passports for visa processing since the hotel was outside the airport. They initially said it will take an hour or 2 but we had to wait much longer in cold uncomfortable chairs in the middle of the night to get the visa for the hotel transfer. We asked them to let us in a lounge but that was not a possibility. So we lost more than 1 day, where most of it was wasted waiting in the airport due to delay or visa preparation. I was tired, hungry, sick and without a change of cloths, i asked them for Panadol but even that was not possible, i had to buy it myself. I have never seen such a poor customer service - the staff were rude and expected us to be understanding without even proper apology. Avoid this airline if you have other options. ;"""worst flight I experienced by far""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The seat configuration on the Boeing 787 is 3-3-3 which means if you are unlucky enough to be in a window seat you have no chance of getting out of your seat to stretch your legs or go to the bathroom etc. You are basically trapped in your seat for the duration of the flight. The food and service on board was appalling. The food was literally inedible and they must have been short of staff because they were not to be found for most of the flight. Flying from Bangkok to Dublin via Abu Dhabi are two long flights and one would expect a better overall quality of service from a full service airline such as Etihad. With so much competition going on in the air with the various airlines it surprises me that Etihad are not better than they are. Don't even get me started on the two and a half hours in transit in Abu Dhabi. ;"""food and service on board was appalling""";"

Not Verified |  Booked a flight from London to Adelaide, transiting through Abu Dhabi and Melbourne. A couple of days after I booked and paid for flight, they wrote to me claiming that due to Australian Government caps on 'unvaccinated' passengers, they would not allow me to board the flight. They said that I could instead fly from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne the day before. That's great geniuses, but what about the legs from London to Abu Dhabi and from Melbourne to Adelaide?  I asked Etihad this simple question twice  and twice they failed to answer. I cancelled the flight in disgust, requested a refund and rebooked with Singapore Airlines, who flew me the same day I was originally scheduled to fly. You know, the same day Etihad insisted I could not fly due to Australian government limits. When I cancelled the flight via Expedia, I was informed Etihad would be deducting a cancellation fee from the refund, even though it Etihad who cancelled my original flight and failed to provide me with a valid alternative! So now I have to pursue them for the cost of the cancellation fee. Etihad are a disgrace.;"""deducting a cancellation fee""";"

It took me 2 months of dealing with Etihad before getting to a point of writing a negative review, as I never do that. Which means I had given them many chances to fix my experience, which only got worse. I was surprised to be dealing (for over 2 months) with phone & FB representatives who gave me false promises, attitude and zero help. From guaranteeing a certain rate for extra luggage (I called to check, as the price in unavailable prior to purchasing a ticket) to ending up paying almost twice that amount (after already paying a very exaggerated amount for my one-way ticket), to poor communication and having to check the status of my complaint every week or so (which was not handled, of course, until this day), and to book a specific seat, which after getting confirmation turned out to not be available (3 different seats- same issue). I was never offered compensation, even after asking for it, and only got embarrassing answers from different people, plus promises to get a call back from a supervisor - which never happened.

Not Verified |  By far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I purchased seats for an extra $128 when I booked my flights. My return flight was changed to a day later than what I booked. All reserved seats were eliminated so I had no assigned seats. I tried to rebook the seats online but they wanted to charge me for the seats again. I called the help center and after 1:20 minutes on hold, the agent told me to purchase the seats again and then request a refund. I replied that wasn't an option and finally got the agent to reassign my seats without a charge. Fast forward a few weeks and there is another flight schedule change. All assigned seats are lost again. Online attempt to recover wants me to pay again. Another long call to customer service to get resolved. Now it is check in time. After check in I find the paid for seats have been lost and instead I am given poor seats in the rear of the plane. Two additional calls to customer service being told they cannot change my seats nor will they refund the money I paid for the seats but they can assign the correct seats for the return flights. Thirty minutes after the call I log back into their website to see if I can download my boarding passes. Surprise!

✅ Trip Verified |  As a former Gold member of Etihad, the airline has become increasingly disappointing over the years.  Flight booked on Etihad website from Cape Town to Dubai. Etihad cancels Cape Town leg, stating they no longer fly to Cape Town. Departure point is changed to Johannesburg, approx 1500km away. Etihad books a local flight on British Airways after numerous phone calls to an incompetent disinterested call centre. Flight cancelled again. This time Etihad refuses to re-book a local flight. I have to pay extra and book a separate flight to Johannesburg, or run the risk of losing my entire Etihad flight.  Bus journey Abu Dhabi - Dubai is uneventful (once you find them in the open parking lot). There are no proper directions from arrival to the bus area. Once you arrive there you have to stand around waiting for the bus driver to arrive, no seating area as you're in the middle of a parking lot. Return bus journey to Abu Dhabi. There is no Etihad bus station, only a parking lot behind an old shopping centre. They state in their emails that you have to be there 2 hours before the time. Their call centre's response: that's just the way it is. Then you have to wait on the street (in the Dubai climate) for the bus. How can a company treat its loyal patrons with such contempt? Etihad can - they're just too big and too rich to care.;"""become increasingly disappointing""";"

Check in no real line they check whoever come to the counter. Boarding was the same. The flight attendants they were not organized. They go back and forth for each person to serve lunch. There was no food menu. No paper or electronic. So technically you don’t know what they serve. The seats were a torture. Old uncomfortable seats.  This is my first and last experience and I don’t recommend Etihad to any traveller. On our way back we were denied boarding. They told me that We can not board because our Covid test it was 36 hours not 24 hour.  Although we are fully vaccinated. They can just simply offer to test us again before the flight and wait in the plane till the result is back as there was a testing facility at the airport that give results in 2 hours and they didn’t even mention They are very cheap and heartless individuals.;"""a bad experience at all levels""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  This was the worst flight experience I have ever had. The flight left 1.5 hrs late, resulting in me and many other passengers missing our connecting flights in Abu Dhabi. Despite knowing that a large number of people had close connections, Etihad did not hold any flights (although they had announced they would). I waited in a mob scene at the transfer desk for 10 hrs before finally being rebooked on a flight that was not leaving Abu Dhabi for another day-and-a-half. Etihad sent me to a hotel outside of the airport and assured me someone would pick me up the following day 3 hrs before my re-scheduled flight. The promised transport never came, and I ended up having to take a cab back to the airport. When I arrived 2 days late in Muscat, my luggage was missing. Turns out it had never left Abu Dhabi. It took Etihad another 3 days to get the luggage to Muscat, by which time I had moved on to my final destination of Salalah. Etihad refused to send the luggage to me in Salalah because they do not fly there (other airlines do, but throughout this fiasco they would not consider putting either me or my luggage on a different airline).

✅ Trip Verified |  Not much issues with the Outbound travel, except the flight crew attitude. The worst experience was at my Inbound journey. Let me start from the beginning On my flight from Cochin to Abu Dhabi, I had to wait for almost 1.30 Hrs. to get OK to Board. As you aware on arrival UAE visa is available for all US Green card holders. However the ground staff keep staying they need an OK to board. At last they manage to resolve that issue and I paid $100 for my additional baggage for Cochin to Charlotte. Again the flight crew experience was not good. In my Inbound travel there was a stopover of 2 days at Abu Dhabi. Due to Covid issues , I called the call center and make sure the reporting time is 3 hours prior to departure. On 6th morning I reached the departure Terminal at 6.30 AM, There was a long queue and all flights check in was done through the same counter. That looks weird to me. Usually there is a separate counter for each flight. The line was not moving so fast, so I report to your ground staff that my flight is for US, I have to do multiple immigration. The response is to stay in line At 8.00AM they called me and sent to separate counter for check in. Again in that that counter I have to wait for 15 minutes to get my turn. Check in staff verified all papers and visa Docs, then they advise me to pay $100 again for additional baggage. I told them that I already paid that money at Cochin and showed the receipt. Check in staff escalated that issue to her supervisor (that took another 15 minutes). Supervisor insist me to pay another $100 for additional baggage. Due to shortage of time, I couldn’t argue with them and agreed to pay. She sent me to another counter where I handover my US Visa credit card. He can’t process the payment in that counter due to some access issues, so he sent me back to the check in counter again. That exercise went 3 times. At the end I have to exchange the dollars in wallet to settle the payment (lost almost $15 on money exchange). At last they released me from the check in counter 45 minutes before flight departure. Literally I had to run to complete the immigration formalities. Again the flight crew experience was not good from AUH to JFK At JFK I got an announcement from Etihad staff that I can collect the luggage only at my final destination I got only 1 check in baggage at charlotte out of 2, 2nd one I got on Saturday morning (Jan 8th). ;"""worst experience was my Inbound journey""";"

Not Verified |  Terrible. Second worst airline I've ever flown with and I cannot even send them feedback because their feedback form doesn't work (keeps taking me back to the first step when I press continue). You know an airline is not good when you cannot even provide them with your feedback (I've been trying for days now). The only thing that was good about my flight with Etihad was that the food was edible and some of it was actually quite nice (although 1 meal on a 7 hour flight is stingy, especially when you see the cabin crew chowing down on leftover business class food). A few of the ground staff were very nice and the chairs are comfortable (the only major plus) but otherwise I would not recommend flying with Etihad at all.;"""not recommend flying with Etihad""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Four legs with B787-9. Aircrafts clean, average inflight service and food. Check in in Malpensa of more than an hour. The Boeing 787 is quite silent, but the seat configuration 3-3-3 is really penalizing. Hard seats, after some hours of flight they are unbearable, difficult to sleep.

✅ Trip Verified |  Shocking that in 2022, Etihad would put us up in such an aircraft. Absolutely dated like from the 80s, no full-recline seats in Business Class. No cheese options with wine. Dessert with the western meal for Business at night was fruit salad. Must say, the hostess was exceptional. She even took down a complaint about the above, & said someone would call me, but no one bothered to.;"""no full-recline seats in Business Class""";"

Not Verified |  Whilst going to and returning from Sydney the in flight experience was very good, the ground services were appalling. At Heathrow check in took over 45 minutes. At Sydney although bags were marked priority we and other business class passengers were the last to be able to retrieve our luggage. On the return flight the business lounge at Abu Dhabi was overcrowded and difficult to find a seat On arrival at Heathrow baggage reclaim was similar to Sydney with our luggage and that of other business class passenger being the last to be retrieved having eventually being found on another carousel. I sent an email complaining which had to be followed after a week later to elicit a reply. Eventually I received a reply saying that they were noting my observations This was followed almost immediately with another email saying complaint resolved. If flying business class I expect the whole flying experience to be good. This was definitely not so with Etihad and will make me wary next time.;"""ground services were appalling""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I will comment about the attitude of the cabin crew on the Abu-Dhabi to Barcelona leg of my journey. I got the impression that the passengers were treated more of as an annoyance than paying customers by most members of the cabin crew. Also for a a long-haul journey, it seems not acceptable that not once were we offered a refill for our juice / coffee. And on entering and exiting the airplane, no greetings from the cabin crew. I will never fly Etihad again.;"""I will never fly Etihad again""";"

Cabin crew service not great at all, crew need a lesson on how to actually deliver proper service including a drinks and snack service, before handing out food that you don’t really have a clue what is in this food. Snacks were a rubbish tasteless Bombay type mix nothing else on offer. Food dry and tasteless. Cabin crew some were nice some just thought they were a cut above their passengers. Nothing good at all to say about the service full stop. Definitely will not book with them again.;"""Definitely will not book with them again""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  This is regarding my booking in Etihad Airways. I request the refund on 27-Dec-2021 due to the Covid conditions in one of my family members. I waited 2 weeks and then called Etihad about the status and I was told that it was processed on 29-Dec. I wanted another 2 weeks and asked again on 29-Jan-2022 and was told it was not processed. I escalated the issue and someone called me and confirmed that he is processing on the same day. I called again on 05-Feb-22 and was told it has processed on 04-Feb-2022. Each time I was asked to wait another 45 days. Due to this confusion, I am not sure if the request has been processed or not? and are all the agents lying?

✅ Trip Verified | Madrid - Doha - Sharjah (Round Trip) because of the stopover in Doha in which you can stay up to 4 days in Doha and pay 40€ per night in 5* hotel such as Marriott Marquis Doha. I didn't want to pay the 83€ for the Emergency seat, as it is too high for a 6:30 flights. The seat pitch in the economy seats on the B787 (MAD - DOH), B777 (DOH - MAD) and A320 (DOH -SHJ) is smaller,  a small difference but my knees could feel the difference. The food on the flight is good and of course was happy that on the long flights they offer free wine. In Doha after passport control,  I had to wait almost 1 hour because the flight was a bit late, the waiting place  was so full that there was no place to sit for many passengers. The Wi-Fi didn't work and there were no toilets in this boarding gate. ;"""they offer free wine""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying from Düsseldorf to Malé via Doha on Qatar Airways. The service was very professional and at times excellent. The food was mostly decent, definitely above average for Economy. Finally, operations were very reliable. All flights were on time, and the boarding and deplaning processes were well-organized. On the Boeing 787-8 the legroom was awful and restrained by a large inflight entertainment box under the seat in front, the seat was quite hard, and the headrest could not be adjusted on the sides. This seat was probably among the most uncomfortable that I have experienced on a wide-body plane. Overall, I would fly Qatar Airways again if the price is right. But I would not pay a premium for this experience.;"""Boeing 787-8 the legroom was awful""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The planes from Athens to Doha and back were extremely old A330-300. Seat space is limited, if you take a window seat there is a metal box in front of you. No wifi, no USB, LCD screen has limited brightness / contrast. Entertainment full of 2nd class movies and series. Doha airport lounge access is extremely expensive and restricted, which offered only 2 different dishes. Impossible to find a proper place to relax, only good option was the shower available. I tried to add the cheaper lounge before my flight but was not allowed because you have to do that 48 hours before the flight. Toilets are quite limited, I had to wait in line for 10 min for a toilet booth. Boarding was organized chaos in all 4 flights, especially the last one from Doha to Athens, where we had to had to use buses. Wait in line for a bus to arrive and delayed departure because of that. Check in was OK in Athens, very slow in Bangkok, had to wait 40 min in line. Food and service was fine in all flights but nothing spectacular, for example no sparkling water. Wifi was advertised in the flight from Doha to Bangkok but it worked only from Bangkok to Doha. In all, a pretty average to poor experience.;"""extremely old A330-300""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  From arriving at the airport on our journey and throughout the cabin staff were run off there feet, and are a credit to the firm. Very pleasant and accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Having read the baggage policies many times, and cutting our baggage to a minimum, I was appalled at how many people were over the limit on size, number and weight of the cabin luggage. The cabin staff are having to struggle on moving bags around to get everybody accommodated, they should not be lifting these overweight bulky items to a level higher than they are. Then having to pacify a complaining passenger whose bag was more than the accepted size because they had to move it further down the cabin.

The transit experience at Hamad international Airport was great, from disembarking the plane, going to the lounge and then boarding the plane again to Islamabad was pleasant and easy. The ground staff were very pleasant, professional and eager to help. Next step on board the flight was equally nice. Would especially like to mention the supervisor from Lebanon who introduced himself to all business class passengers and personally helped the staff. I didn’t eat during the flight as wanted to sleep, but I am sure it would have been a good experience.

✅ Trip Verified |  My experience on Qatar Airways was flawless from beginning to end. Check-in was a breeze, the service and amenities at the lounge in Doha was exceptional (staff were especially kind). In-flight was outstanding. Minimal number of cabin announcements which were efficiently delivered. Service was attentive without being intrusive. The food served was outstanding. The quantity offered personified the Arab hospitability custom of making sure you were never in want. I can't think of any flight experience where I was provided such comfort and lavished with such attention in such a non-intrusive manner. I was in an oasis of calm, quiet rest. It's going to be very hard to not route my future trips through Doha on Qatar Airways - thank you to the Qatar Airways team - truly exceptional.;"""My experience was flawless""";"

The lounge at Heathrow was fantastic – particularly the staff - who couldn’t do enough for you.

✅ Trip Verified |  They’re currently using elderly A330 on the Nairobi route and these aren’t very comfortable compared to the B787 or B777 they used to bring to Nairobi. Terrible seat pitch. Tiny, faded IFE screens and the dreaded metal box under the seats that takes up half your legroom. And not enough room for carry on luggage if the plane is full. My flight from Doha to Nairobi was packed to the rafters so they were randomly selecting passengers to give up their hand luggage so that it could be put in the hold so as not to overwhelm the overhead bins on board. I had my standard cabin-approved trolley bag which I was told needed to be checked in. I had to remove my electronics and valuables and stuff these in my laptop bag to carry on board. I was given a flimsy zip tie to secure my bag and off it went into the hold. On arrival in Nairobi, it was one of the last bags to make it to the luggage conveyor belt. The flight was a night flight, so I opted to get some sleep rather than wait for dinner. After managing to fall asleep, I was awoken twice to be asked if I wanted to have dinner, which I clearly did not. On the plus side, the flight was bang on time to the minute, only marred by the long wait for baggage on arrival. Nairobi is a busy route for QR (most of their flights are full) so I don’t know why they put such a mediocre airplane type on it. ;"""elderly A330 on the Nairobi route""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  My first time flying with Qatar, and what a wonderful experience it was! Despite the long flight (21 hours in the air in each direction), every leg was excellent. Seats were comfortable and spacious - with excellent legroom. Even on relatively short 4 hour flights there were pillows and blankets on each seat. IFE was decent, with a wide selection of movies and programmes to choose from. The food was all of a high standard - a good selection (usually 3 choices) of meals, and each was tasty and filling. I was very impressed with the alcohol selection - a sparkling wine (rare in economy class), quality red and white wine, two beers, and a small selection of spirits. Most impressive of all was the service: the crew were friendly, attentive, and polite. Drink runs were regular, and staff were engaging and highly professional. On one leg with few passengers, the staff were wonderful - constantly checking up on us, offering more drinks, proactively offering to make a festive cocktail (in economy class!), and ensuring our comfortable. All flights were on-time, and Doha airport was a pleasure to transit through. I was very impressed with Qatar, and look forward to flying them again.;"""what a wonderful experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  After being stranded in CDG Airport by Vietnam Airlines I was thankfully able to book a flight home to Sydney in economy to make a family wedding. The cost, 4.2k, I can understand it's a high price to pay for a last minute flight that I booked a little over 12 hours in advance, but it's insulting to have an empty seat on the flight next to me and several other empty seats on the flight.  I paid an extra 90 euros to get into the business class lounge for my 13 hour layover, no where when I selected this option, informed me that the ticket is for only 6 hours in the business lounge.  My seat on the A388 was horrible, I was in front of the bathroom. I couldn't eat on the plane.

The usual remote bus transfer in Doha. I can’t recall any airbridge arrival/departure (besides A380 flights) over the past 2 years. Reminds me of the old Doha Airport. Bus transfer took ages this time, because of a very remote position of aircraft and several long stops on the way. The usual stressful transit security check I have not seen at any other airport for years. Al Safa lounge as always a great place to relax and rewind.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. ";"""given exit row without charges""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight.

It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos.

Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. ;"""Total pandemonium at the gate""";"

"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great.";"""I don´t think there is anything better out there""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended.;"""Great trip as always with Qatar""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page.;"""the amenities were outdated""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible.

✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address.;"""chat support is also very poor""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. ;"""very spacious and comfortable""";"

Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad.;"""I cannot recommend Qatar Airways""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again.;"""will certainly fly QA again""";"

However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding.

✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops).

We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one.

✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months).

"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable.

"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better.

✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again.;"""Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways""";"

The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys.

✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. ;"""people were left alone""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. ;"""worse seat than the non exit row""";"

The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic.

Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great.

✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.;"""experience fell short of my expectations""";"

This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line).

It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined.

✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. ;"""quality of the food has disappeared """;"

Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic.";"""they are cutting services""";"

I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. ";"""Good experience overall""";"

✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!;"""Rebook for a lower class of service""";"

✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again.;"""excellent hospitality""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. ;"""entertainment system is limited""";"

After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between.

✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service.

✅ Trip Verified |  I am writing to you to express my great dissatisfaction with my recent experience with Saudi Airlines. January 3rd flew Saudia from Washington DC to Lahore via Jeddah and encountered terrible service. I lost my Hand-carry which they took away at time of getting into the plane. The service I received from the airline staff was unprofessional, rude, and slow. My flight was delayed for 19 hours at Jeddah airport, and when I asked the staff for an explanation, they were unable to provide one. I found the staff attitude towards customers to be unhelpful and dismissive. Worse yet, when my flight finally arrived, my hand-carry was nowhere to be found. I had to purchase new clothes, toiletries, and other items in order to make it through the rest of my trip. I had to pay for these items out of my own pocket. I was also disappointed in the customer service I received when I reported the lost baggage. The staff was unhelpful and unsympathetic, and it was clear that they did not take my complaint seriously. They refused to give me a claim number by saying that it was not needed. I have tried to contact the airline both by phone and email, but I have not yet been able to speak to any customer service representatives who can provide me with information regarding my hand-carry. They hung-up the phone on me when I asked for some help. I have now been without my luggage for over three weeks and have yet to receive any response from the airline.;Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review;"

However, nobody called me or seemed to care about my lost baggage except for me. I finally got my bag after 9 days. I arrived for a two week stay in India. That is not acceptable service. I had no clothes or my medication for 9 straight days. I had no jacket or sweater for warmth at night.

I understand that rules are rules, however I was told that the issue was not the excessive weight. I then suggested wrapping the mat with my main check in luggage and was told that this was not allowed. I told them that I had done this with Saudia recently, the staff involved were unable to show me where it says that this was not allowed. The ground staff let the airline down and I ended up paying excessively without being told the reason. Was it that my ticket allowed only one piece of luggage? Why could I not carry some weight on my backpack if this would mean being charged less. The staff were absolutely unhelpful and offered terrible customer service.

✅ Trip Verified |  I spent a span of 21 hours flying Saudia across three regions of the world in economy and satisfied with my experience in the whole. To start, the pros to flying Saudia was the price, seating and it's incredible staff. My flight was extremely affordable relative to competitors and the seats were fantastic due to having a lot of empty seats around. Additionally, inflight crew were  friendly and took initiative in the most authentic way. I felt well looked after in the most genuine way! As for my cons, they dealt with the lack of cleanliness, catering and online infrastructure. My seat from Geneva and to a lesser extent out of Jeddah to Seoul wasn't the cleanest. One of my flights had residual trash in the seat pocket and a lot of dirt was wiped off using a wet towel. Moreover, I get that economy food doesn't have a reputation for being 5-star, but the pasta I had was rubbery, tasteless and inept at hiding the fact that it was mass produced. Finally, Saudia could invest a little in improving their online/app features for requesting special meals as they were difficult to navigate and calling was too much trouble due to prolonged wait times. In summary, Saudia is a great full service airline to fly for those who value comfort and service for a price that doesn't break the bank!;"""great full service airline"" ";"

Everything was ok until i got a message last night that my first flight was rescheduled to a week later while the other flights were on the date of departure.

I asked them how they can reschedule the first flight and not change the rest of the flights. They couldn't help me with anything.

They refused to cooperate with me, the call center would say that they have raised it to a department and the ticketing office would say it’s not our problem and asked me to deal with call center. They kept fooling around until the flight was about to close and I was forced to by new tickets to go back home at a ridiculous high price. And now they are refusing to refund my previous return ticket.  I will never book this airline or recommend anyone to book it, and if The Kingdom expects to bring in more tourists through this airline and with this customer service, then good luck.

Similar experience on the phone. When you do get through, including by raising an official complaint on the system, you get told it is resolved, but when checking, it is not. And the loop starts again. This is the main issue I'm facing. But overall, food quality is below average, plans are not very clean and prices are therefore high for what you get.

✅ Trip Verified | I flew Saudia Airlines Jeddah to Washington Dulles in business class. My seat would not operate so I could not adjust the seat. My entertainment system did not work so I could not watch the entertainment. Not what I expected or paid for (over $8,000 USD) during a 14 hour flight. The flight attendant supervisor tried to no avail to fix the problems, causing a disruption in the cabin multiple times. He provided me an email address for Saudia customer relations, which I have emailed a week ago with no response (and multiple follow on emails also with no response). Saudia website has a customer feedback form but the website just spins when you try to submit (I've tried to submit every day for a week to no avail). Saudia has an online chat but they just send you a link to the website form that does not work. So - that's the customer service you get - nothing! By the way, before the flight I had trouble with the Saudia app and each time I called an agent they gave me an email address for assistance and you guessed it - none of my emails were responded to.

✅ Trip Verified |  First time with Saudia Airlines, totally different between the first leg Amsterdam-Jeddah with the second Jeddah- Lahore. I fly with Saudia because I belong to Skyteam Alliance and I'm a Platinum pax so I have a lot of benefits. Amsterdam-Jeddah with B787 in ECO: Ground staff very kind in Schipol and she put us in the exit seats, that means a lot of leg-room. The service was good, doesn't stand out especially if you compare with other Middle Eastern airlines. But a little better than American or European airlines. Seat ok with foot-rest, entertainment ok, food ok, a little plus with amenity bag with earplugs, eyes mask and socks. Of course no alcholic drinks. Flight Attendants were kind and ok. In Jeddah transfer: nice and new airport, very clean and everything is new. For connecting flights you should pass other security control, that was a little bit messy between the line for normal pax and the SkyPriority line. Luckily had a lot of time to transfer. Jedddah-Lahore with B777, was totally different. We upgraded (biding system) Aircraft looks old. Flight Attendants looked tired and disorganized but very kind (because C class?). The most important was that I could sleep a couple hours. Food on demand but was not really special. Will I fly again with them - probably yes if the price is ok and of course will still be in the Alliance.;"""Flight Attendants looked tired and disorganized""";"

Lahore airport is old, a lot of security, a little bit disorganized, Checking counter staff was kind and once again she put us in the row with big leg-room. The boarding gate area is a mess, no priority lines. Its like the wild west and after passing the boarding pass control another security control in the finger just before get onto the plane. So delayed, one hour. Lahore-Jeddah, B-777, in ECO, totally full, majority of passengers were pilgrims to Jeddah. Service on board - this time there were no amenity bag for red eye flight. I had bad luck with the pax next to me, big and his arm reached over my side, that was very uncomfortable. I didn't eat nor watch any movies, just slept or tried to. Flight attendants attitude was totally different, less kind. Transfer in Jeddah, this time was better, because there were hardly any people so it was very fast. Jeddah-Amsterdam, B-787 upgraded by biding system (paid 370 eu.) and totally worth to pay it, totally different business class than Jeddah - Lahore. Nice seat, comfy. A plus, chef on board. Amenity bag from Missoni. Nothing can compare with Emirates or Qatar Business.;"""different impression between first and second leg""";"

The service people took our boarding passes and misbehaved with people. They would vanish from the counter and return after hours and would not give answers. We were treated as we animals without proper seating, without food and water, and when we asked for some water they would straight away refuse.;"""They would vanish from the counter and would not give answers""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Do not fly with this airline. My experience with Saudia was not only the worst that I’ve had with any airline, but also the worst I’ve had with any company. The customer support is virtually non-existent and when you need any form of help, this company proves that it couldn’t care less. I flew with my girlfriend from Frankfurt to Bangkok with a layover in Riyadh. The TVs in our row didn’t work on both flights, but otherwise the flights went okay and the food was pretty good. Once we landed in Bangkok we realised my girlfriend’s bag had failed to arrive. We had noticed in Frankfurt that the Saudia representative at baggage drop hadn’t actually put the bag on the baggage carousel, but at the time we didn’t think much of it. Luckily, we had an Apple AirTag inside the luggage, so we could see it was still at Frankfurt Airport and had never left. We reported it to the baggage department at Bangkok Airport, although there were no Saudia representatives in Bangkok specifically. We filed a Baggage Irregularity Report and were told that Saudia should send the bag within the next few days. Saudia never sent the bag to us. We tried contacting them so many times over the following days and weeks. We emailed so many email addresses that we found online, but the majority of them were not even real accounts and so our emails failed to deliver. We tried calling customer service representatives for Saudia in Thailand, Germany and the UK, but either the phone numbers didn’t work, they just didn’t pick up, or they said they couldn’t help at all and we just had to fill out the form online. We filled out the online compensation form in August 2022, but to this day have received no response. We spent nearly €100 on calls from Thailand to Saudia’s helplines but nothing worked. We tweeted them many times and while they did message us back saying they would help, we never heard anything further. This was especially frustrating as the whole time we could see with our AirTag that the bag was just sitting in Frankfurt Airport. It was clear to us that Saudia were making no attempt to find the bag. Eventually, my girlfriend’s parents had to travel to Frankfurt Airport to find the bag. They asked around and showed that they could find it with the AirTag. Luckily, with baggage staff at the airport, they found the bag.  Frankfurt Airport then flew it over to us with Thai Airways, and then we picked it up from Phnom Penh airport in Cambodia, more than two weeks after the bag had gone missing. The worst part was that Saudia never listened to us. They have no customer service and did not offer any help. We contacted Saudia again and again to tell them we knew where it was, but nothing. We even went back to Bangkok Airport to talk to Saudia representatives in person who are only in the airport at specific times when flights are happening. They were friendly but offered no help, blaming Frankfurt Airport for the issue. When we contacted Frankfurt Airport, they blamed Saudia for not looking for the bag. It was clear to us that if my girlfriend’s parents hadn’t gone to the airport to find the bag, it would’ve just been left there and eventually auctioned off. We have still received zero compensation.;"""it couldn’t care less""";"

Not Verified | AVOID at all costs. This is one of the worst airlines (if not the worst) I have ever flown. While the planes and the cabin crew are reasonable the rest of the organisation and staff are not. we booked flight 6 months early to ensure everything would be ok. Getting through to them if you have a query is extremely difficult and after 50 or so calls still no clarity on seat allocations/changing dates/times and other queries. When you do there is no one who can really answer any question or can even speak some English. Website is not very informative. Check-in is VERY unfriendly and you are asked for documents that are not asked on other airlines. The final straw was when we missed a flight in Jeddah to Dubai the customer services were EXTREMELY unhelpful and rude given we had 2 young children stuck in Saudi at 12.30am in the morning. In fact they cancelled all our onward flights and did not make any attempt to help us get on our original flights. Instead they made us purchase new flights at a very significant cost. They split our luggage and sent some to Dubai and off boarded some in Jeddah. On the return journey the plane landed late and we had 45 minutes for our connecting flight in Jeddah. There was no real attempt to help us get to our connection and were left in Jeddah airport at 1.15am in the morning with 2 young children to figure out how to get our connection in the short window. A terrible travelling experience. Please avoid as your holiday may become an unpleasant experience regardless of the cost.;"""A terrible travelling experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Saudi Arabian Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown. I travelled from US to Jeddah, and the plane was clean and staff was somewhat nice. Then from Jeddah to Lahore, Pakistan, the staff was very unprofessional and the airline was not well-maintained, it was like riding a local bus. On my way back to the US, they would not let me board food items on the plane, when that is not the case going to Pakistan. They made me check-in my food items, which were inside plastic bags. By the time I came to the US, my food was damaged and my bags were damaged. Saudia Arabian airline staff and the airport security at Jeddah have serious attitude problems.;"""worst airline I have ever flown""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Where do I even start?? I opted to upgrade to Business Class (I made an offer and it was accepted) and wish I never did. The coffee is truly horrible (no taste of coffee. It is dark yellowish as you can see for yourself in the photo). They had no special meals option neither in economy nor in Business (they wrote to me on their WhatsApp number that the special meal option is currently suspended). It is mind boggling that on routes from India a major national airline would not have a vegetarian option and I even suspect they ejected this on purpose! The only good cabin crew was a Filipina girl who really did her best. An Indian girl and a local Arab guy (both young in their late twenties) did their job fine. The rest of the cabin crew were not service orientated in any way. About 60% into the flight from Istanbul to Riyadh (the map showed that the plane was above the Red Sea) the flight attendant told me they ran out of drinking water (!) I realised this already during the meal service when people were prompted to ask for soft drinks or juice as there was no water left. This practice of not stocking enough water (despite that the flight was 75% empty!) is criminally negligent because if an emergency of any sort occurs and a flight must be diverted (it happened in the past couple of years more than once due to Yemeni missiles) the passengers are left with no drinking water for up to 4 or 5 hours which is not ok! The new airport terminal in Jeddah is beautiful but the food options are ridiculous. Warning: the terminal is freezing so bring a jacket and long pants unless you wish to get a bad cold during your journey. Each and every food venue in the terminal is a junk food outlet and (again) there is no option for vegetarians. During the check in process and despite that I flew business class the ground staff had no idea that I don't require a visa to Turkiye. They really should train their staff to realise that EU passport holders don't need a visa to Turkiye and that this has been the case for half a century already instead of wasting passengers time at the check in desk for twenty minutes. The airport in Riyadh is old and the lounge is below mediocre. You can't even get a decent coffee in the entire terminal which pretty much sums up the experience. The in-flight entertainment is a (bad) joke. On the Mumbai to Jeddah flight they had a two hour programme showing how a Saudi Prince won the Saudi Cup. Passengers had no choice but to see this prince jumping up and down for long minutes waving a large golden cup (at the same time the Nepalese or Indian jockey was awarded a tiny trophy). The toilets were not cleaned during the flight. In fact the business class toilet was not even sanitized before the flight from Mumbai to Jeddah (I was the first one to use it and noticed hand cream was spurted on the space above the toilet seat!). I can't see how Saudia can compete against the various Gulf carriers with such policies (it can't).;"""I can't see how Saudia can compete against the various Gulf carriers""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from London to New Delhi, India with Saudia on 23rd of September, 2022. My layover at Jeddah was changed from 12 to 24 hours and I am informed only a day before flying. When I reach Jeddah and ask if I am being accommodated in a hotel, I am being told the airline is not responsible. The staff was rude and impolite. He told me to complain about the delay on the customer care as if writing at the last hour would solve my problem, when he in person was not ready to entertain me. They have all the time to send you emails regarding upgrades for business class but they don't have time to send you emails about the delay. I was probably expected to take a transit visa and find a hotel somewhere in Jeddah city which I have never visited and that also at night. The airlines was least bothered about my safety and discomfort. First they do not inform you about the delay on time and then put all the blame on you. On top of that wifi at Jeddah airport was not working. What a bizarre situation I was in. I would not recommend Saudia if you have other options in hand. Though I have no complains about onboard facilities. Flying attendants were good. The food was tasty with more options.;"""I would not recommend Saudia""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Jakarta via Jeddah. I cannot understand that an Airline like this could exist. The service on board is the worst I ever experienced. I called the customer service because something went wrong with my upgrade to business. My offer was accepted but only for 1 person instead of 3. I cancelled it and do it again, again it was accepted but again only for 1 person. I contacted Saudia on Facebook and after the autobot they say they would contact me for this upgrade but they didn't I called the following telephone numbers from their contact list : USA, Singapore, Saudia, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, UK, Germany etc. (so all the phone numbers) because I booked online I contacted the agent and they also could do it for me and told me again to call to Saudia. I told them I cannot reach them and they told me they cannot do anything for me. After that Í emailed them and again not reply until this day. I never experience this kind of service before. And I'm not letting it by for this. I find this the WORST airlines that there is for customer service. I hope after other people see this review they won't book there.

Food quality is mediocre, Chicjen Biryani had no taste, chick peas salad was stale, unhealthy options. Later they served chicken salad sandwich as a snack , it was wrapped in plastic wrap with 3 pcs of bread, it was more bread then sandwich.

✅ Trip Verified |  Would have never considered Saudia in the past but chose it because of ridiculously low fare in business class. Every single element of the flight wad good to great. Check in in Athens and in Kuala Lumpur was easy and there was a dedicated business counter. Transiting in Jeddah was straightforward but I assume we benefited from being first off the plane. Lounge in Athens was ok. Jeddah was very spacious and totally empty. Decent food selection. . In Kuala Lumpur Saudia is using the Malaysian Airlines lounge. Flights were reasonably on time. There was a 60 min delay taking off in KUL but it didn't affect our connection. Staff were friendly and helpful in all segments. On the ATH-JED segments the crew was very attentive. Seats are standard Flatbeds on the 787. Perfectly comfortable for a good night's sleep. I was impressed by also having Flatbeds on the small Airbus. Didn't use entertainment system. WiFi was supposed to be available but we couldn't find it. Food was good to great. It's on demand service and we managed to go to sleep after take off and only eat once we woke up. No alcohol served. Luggage was Priority tagged and arrived first. I was really impressed and relieved, Especially at the low price point. Would I choose Saudia over other airlines of the price was the same? Probably not. But for a decent Biz experience at a very low price I can't fault it.;"""ridiculously low fare in business class""";"

When I asked the reason he said that's my shift and I don't take stroller inside. I asked to speak to the supervisor just to explain to him that we used the same from Cairo then he seems to be not the supervisor and refer me to the crew who have showed same attitude with no explanation as if I begging from him.;"""I had a very bad experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Amsterdam via Riyadh. My sister and I bought a return flight ticket to travel from Amsterdam to Singapore. We saved a long time our money for this trip, because we are only students. We had a lovely travel, until it we had to fly back. We tried to check in into our flight at the counter on the airport of Singapore. However, we were denied to join the flight. The reason for this was that we didn't had a transit visa. It was very traumatic and stressful for us to be denied from this flight. We tried everything we could to obtain a transit visa. However, the website to gain a transit or tourist visa was not working The my.gov.sa denied access to open the website. The other website was not working because we couldn't upload any pictures. We tried everything but nothing worked. We were well informed about this flight before we left. We checked all the information on the emails, website and flight information. However, nowhere was written that we needed a transit or tourist visa to be able to access this flight. It was extremely stressful and traumatic to have been denied access to this flight and we feel scammed by this happening. There were 14 other passenger with us that had the exact same problem. We had to be back in the Netherlands and we were forced to book a very expensive new flight ticket to Amsterdam. No one is willing to help us out. We cannot get in contact with the airlines, as they do not respond to any messages. Therefore I highly recommend everyone to NOT book a flight with Saudi Arabian Airlines.;"""extremely stressful and traumatic""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Manila to London via Riyadh return with my family (2 adults and 2 children). The flight from London to Riyadh has a much better experience as the aircraft are newer and have a better entrainment system (touch screen). However, Riyadh to Manila is a much worse experience. In fact, on our outward journey, the entrainment system was not working for 1 one of us on both legs. The return journey was even worse, 2/4 of the entertainment systems were not functional on a 16 hrs journey! When I raised a concern to a crew member, they just told me to write a review online to influence the, as they put it, ""high bosses"".

✅ Trip Verified |  I had a business trip from Madrid to Riyadh on July 30, 2022. My ticket was on Saudia. After 50 minutes from take-off, the plane landed in Valencia. The Captain informed us that there was a mild technical difficulty that would be fixed in an hour, after which we would resume the flight. When we landed in Valencia, the Captain and the crew left immediately without providing the passengers with any information. The only persons available were the ground service personnel in Valencia airport, who informed us that they had no details and that the Saudia crew had left. The captain asked Valencia ground staff to let us know that the flight would depart from Madrid the next day, August 31. So we had to find our way to Madrid. It was already 3 am when we got the information. The passengers and I were obliged to spend the night on the floor of Valencia airport with no food or water because all the facilities in the airport close at night. I booked a train ticket for 70 Euros from Valencia to Madrid at 7:30 am. When I arrived at the airport, I was informed that the flight had been re-scheduled for July 31 at 6 pm. I tried to check in at the counter at 2 pm, but the agent told me there was no flight, and she did not know when the flight would leave. After waiting four hours, a message arrived that the flight had been re-scheduled to August 1 at 6 pm. This means more than 48 hours of delay. This resulted in my inability to go to my business, I had two bronchial asthma attacks, and I paid a lot for transport. I called Saudia more than ten times, and they never responded. I sent them complaint forms with no response.;"""the Captain and the crew left immediately""";"

Not Verified |  The airline has a clean good onboard product, but the service needs much improvement. I flew Bangkok to Dubai with a layover in Jeddah. Saudia business class adopts dine on demand concept. however they provided no menu card on my Bangkok - Jeddah route. The crew had absolutely no knowledge of the food onboard. They serve 1 meal for an 8 hour long flight and had a very dry presentation. The crew forgot to serve jam/butter for the plain croissant and honey for my yoghurt and when asked rudely replied they are provided on request. The call button is not attended promptly and the crew is not warm and hospitable. The dining experience was disappointing and no munch or beverage service at all throughout the long flight. On my Jeddah to Dubai flight, they rain out of options for meals and was forced to eat only an Arabic bean breakfast which was the only sole option. The in flight entertainment features a decent screen & a headset, but a below average selection for options. For an proper middle eastern business class experience Saudia is not even 10% of what Emirates, Etihad or Qatar offers onboard.

✅ Trip Verified | I am not completely satisfied with my recent experience with Saudi Airlines, even though I hold Alfursan Silver Elite SkyTeam membership. Unfortunately, the service quality has decreased significantly in the recent period. Through several trips, I noticed a big difference in terms of guest care when calling the customer service centre you will wait for no less than 30 minutes, even when you were holding the premium membership, and most of the employees, if you reach them, will not solve your request or make it complicated and not initiating the service. The quality of food on board has deteriorated even to the business class and not only to the economy class and also the fulfilment of requests by ground staff or flight attendant mostly average to bad, and I noticed a lack of flight performance to leave or arrive on time in several flights and also even a large increase in prices and in return without good service I used to choose Saudi Airlines previously for several reasons, including the special membership that I carry, which gives me many wonderful services, beside the average to good service and reasonable prices, but now I will make this company my third or maybe fourth choice, even if my membership is reduced, it does not matter much.;"""service quality has decreased significantly""";"

It's terrible to sit in an aircraft waiting for your fellow passengers with out providing any facility.

✅ Trip Verified |  I was transiting in Istanbul from Nur Sultan via Saudi Air to get to Bangkok. My Saudi Arabian Airlines flight in Istanbul was cancelled. This was one of the worst airline experience I have had as a frequent flier with over 400,000 miles flown. I had to spend 25 hours in transit (15 hours in Istanbul and 10 hours Riyadh) instead of 4 hours as per my original itinerary without any compensation, accommodation or food. When I first arrived at the transit desk in Istanbul, the ground staff told me that the flight was cancelled and that I should call my travel agent. My travel agent then told me to contact the ground staff for accomodation. On returning to the transit desk, I was told that there was a shift change and new staff will be there in 5 minutes. Instead, I waited for 1 hour, and was told by a staff that the flight was cancelled and he could not do anything about it. After much discussion, a staff told me that their system shows that I am rebooked on a flight on July 9, 10 days from my current flight. He said I should head out of the airport to check with the Saudia office and that someone would be there (there was no one after I went out). This was at 2am and I called four offices for Saudia and had no response. I ended up traveling downtown and booked my own hotel after calling the travel agent and he informed me that I was rebooked on a flight 15 hours later. For our next connection, we had a 10 hour layover. The airline staff told us to contact customer service for Saudia when we arrived regarding accomodation. But there is no customer service for Saudia in Riyadh! The information desk kept redirecting us to non-existent customer service desks. The lounge staff for Saudia claimed that they manage the lounge and don't have any relationship to Saudia. I am hoping to get accomodation compensation and damages for my two overnight long layovers (I had to cancel hotels/onward flights as a result of these and had to book hotel stays and taxi in my layovers).;"""no customer service for Saudia""";"

Not Verified |  Ridiculously small food portions and broken arm rests. I flew coach class from Jakarta to Jeddah on Saudia's B777-300 ER, their leather seats are comfy and leg room is spacious. For a ten hour flight the catering was ridiculously limited. An hour into the flight they served a small pizza-snack, and catering was only continued with a breakfast once flying over the Arabian peninsula. Breakfast was Tasteless scrambled eggs, without any side dishes at all. Just a single bread bun. Coffee with milk? Not available. They only serve coffee with creamer-powder. The arm rests in coach class are randomly broken respectively liftable. Flight was half empty and I could had turned my seat row into a bed, however as the arm rests weren't liftable I couldn't make any usage of the empty seats next to me. Different to the passenger in the row in front of me for instance. Inflight entertainment was also randomly broken/working. In my row, not a single screen was working. Also, their digital menus in the inflight system weren't updated.

"✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Dubai via Jeddah. Never again. Flight delayed at first (original departure time 15.55h), finally boarding at 19.30h. At 20.00h (still waiting to enter the plane) the ground staff came to tell us that the flight was cancelled. Only because the pilot had issues with his crew and their flying hours. After the cancellation, no service was provided. All passengers had to find their own way to a certain service desk where (as we were told) they would take care of the situation and try to book all of us on another flight. This service desk was nowhere to be found, nobody was willing to help us. When we finally found the service desk, they told us that maybe the flight might leave after all. (Our luggage was still on the plane). At 21.30h they confirmed that there was no flight and there were no other possibilities to fly to Jeddah or Dubai. The bags should come any minute, the said. At 23.30 h we were still waiting for our baggage. All that time there was no possibility to get something to eat or to drink; not even water was provided.

Not Verified |  My first experience of flying Saudia, the dates I needed plus the value for money made it quite a viable option. I was happy with the booking process plus the contact centre communication, as well as email updates and the app too. Saudi Arabian lose scores because that they have absolutely no idea what customer service means, my connecting flight was rebooked for 15 hours later and I only found out at the boarding gate of my flight, apparently because the flight from London to Jeddah left 30 minutes late I was rebooked. I was completely frustrated as people were boarding the flight to Islamabad and I was just left. There was no help offered by anyone at the airport, I was asking to speak to a representative from the airline but no one was available, 15 hours wasted in the lounge and there was no offer of compensation / accomodation. Logged a complaint but heard nothing back. I will still be pursuing them. The flights were pretty underwhelming, uncomfortable seats, unresponsive screens and cabin crew seemed chaotic and frustrated, the meals were okay and that's pretty much it. I won't be flying with them again, as the whole experience was annoying especially as there was no explanation for why the flight was rebooked also that there was no one to approach about it, any attempts to complain or approach staff were batted away, with the lack of English being cited as the reason for not understanding....;"""flights were pretty underwhelming""";"

Not Verified |  Awful customer service - avoid at all costs. The help desk attendants were all on their cell phones and refused to serve my family and I. They passed us off to 3 different people simply because they couldn't be bothered to help us. When we approached them to help us check in for our flight, the tone of voice and their attitude was completely unacceptable. First the ladies passed us off to the next counter attendants, because they wanted to spend time on their cell phones instead of helping customers. Then when we tried to check in our additional baggage, the men kept sending us back and forth between the guest relations simply because none of them knew where to pay the fees for the additional baggage. Absolutely useless.;"""Awful customer service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Booked a one way ticket and wanted to cancel it to rebook a return ticket after only a few hours (due to additional research), so I went to Manage my Booking as the website requested - only to not be shown any options to change or cancel. I then went to the Refund page, submitted a request, but was not shown the refund amount and website directly proceeded to tell me to wait for the cancellation and refund (and their website is not clear whether they have a 24H full refund policy). I tried to contact them via the website chat as well as whatsapp - after 5 hours there was no response by any agents. I then made the final decision to call their HQ, incurring expensive overseas call charges, waited 33 minutes, and was answered by a bored-sounding customer service staff. I introduced myself and asked if it was okay if I used English to converse. He paused for 5 seconds, then terminated the call. Tens of dollars down the drain. ;"""Absolutely horrendous experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Did check in at the biz counter in Madinah airport and was served by a rude gentleman.  Finally he told me he need a health declaration which was required by Singapore government. After I have completed the online declaration i start again the check in. This time he asked for the booking ticket for my onwards flight KUL- SIN which was operated by MAS. I told him many times that it was reflected on the ticket which i have printed out. The flight details is clearly shown on the printed hard copy ticket. He told me that MAS luggage allowance is 16 kg per pcs. I told him it’s ridiculous and ask him to show me where he read about the luggage allowance. When i read, it is actually referring to carbon emission details and nothing about the luggage allowance. I told him that the info he read is nothing to do with luggage allowance. He then issue the boarding pass after a long unnecessary disruption he made on the service experience he had caused which I clearly unnecessary in the first place.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible. Try to avoid at all cost. Lied about ability to use points, tried to scam me by stranding me in a foreign country and forcing me to pay cash, ignored and hung up when I tried to resolve. I have flown with Saudia numerous times ( out of necessity) and I still keep getting surprised by the level of inadequate services and overall incompetence. On a flight the service is great; however the preflight experience, from booking to customer support is horrible. I have booked 2-way flights using points to find out a few days before my return flight that my booking was in fact not confirmed and that I would have to pay cash (basically sent me to a foreign country, then juked me into paying for a ticket) - I found out by chance when I called them regarding something else, they did not even have the decency to tell me. I have tried multiple times to submit a complaint using their customer relations hotline but have had the phone hung up on me multiple times. I have also requested for a supervisor to reach to me but have not heard back in quite sometime.

Not Verified |  Manchester to Jeddah. All pre flight booking/ticket information from Saudia Airlines stated that departure from Manchester Airport on 15/12/2021 was from Terminal 1. Even phone calls to their customer service team confirmed Manchester Terminal 1 for departure. In actual fact, upon arrival at terminal 1, there were no check-in desks in Terminal 1. They were in Terminal 2! Upon arrival at King Abdul Aziz Airport in Jeddah, waited over two hours for luggage, because, it had been sent to the wrong zone within the airport. This is a newly built airport. No seats in baggage claim. Standing for over two hours, waiting for luggage. No refreshments provided. Not even a bottle of water. Despite protestations to airline staff, just got shrugged shoulders. Nobody cared. Nobody took accountability. This is what Saudia Airlines calls Business Class service. Have since raised several complaints for pro rata compensation claim for these issues on the airline website and, each time, the complaint is closed without acknowledgement of the issues raised or acknowledgement of the compensation claim. Absolutely appalling service. I have flown with 20 airlines worldwide, this happens to be the worst experience of all. Typical arrogance.;"""worst experience of all""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Worst customer service experience I've ever had with an airline in 33 years. We were due to fly from JFK to Delhi, connecting through Jeddah, on December 20th. Saudi proactively cancelled our flights from Jeddah to Delhi with no heads up. Pandemic and preemptive travel closures, sure. We had to call the customer service department multiple times just to cancel our full itinerary. They kept giving us the run around - telling us to contact their WhatsApp support line (more on this), or to email them. Finally, after no success on those fronts, they were able to cancel the flights on our 5th or 6th phone attempt. They claim the customer service phone department - where you can talk to humans - is completely disconnected from refunds processing - and you can only do the latter via WhatsApp or email. The WhatsApp support is the laziest, most lackadaisical responsiveness I've ever seen. They claim 24/7 support but regularly take 6-10 hours to respond to a chat and start a conversation. When they do reply (usually with 1 word or 1 line), if you don't reply within 10 minutes they close the chat out and you have to start the conversation all over again with another agent. - I repeated this cycle for 4 days on repeat just to be able to submit a simple refund request for a flight they cancelled. Phone support was unwilling to process a refund. Once I did eventually get through a submit a refund claim via WhatsApp, the phone agent was unable and unwilling to give me any indication of refund status. So, unclear now whether I've even been refunded for a flight that they cancelled. Do not fly Saudi Arabian Airlines.

However the airline redirected my return flight to another city without any notice. Then they proceeded to cancel the first leg of the same journey, their online portal becomes useless because it blocked any input from me by a popup, I am not sure if it is a bad design or was done intentionally such as to prevent me from taking perfectly legal actions. Their call centers do not respond at all. The calling number they provided doesn't entertain international calls.

Not Verified |  Dammam to Manila with a connecting flight to Riyadh. While we were in Riyadh airport the airline took too much time waiting in the tarmac.

Saudi Airlines gave us the choice to either wait for the next flight inside the airport or go to the hotel which they have booked for us. We decided to go to the hotel, the hotel was very poor and awful. The worst part is, mostly of us have a connecting flights. I have a local connecting flight from Manila to Cagayan de Oro city which i have missed of course because of the delay.

✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Mumbai via Jeddah. First of all let me start with meal plan. There were multiple options to select meal online for eg: Hindu meal, vegetarian meal, etc. My husband selected hindu meal for us as we didn't wanted to eat vegetarian meal as we had heard it is mainly has boiled spinach and boiled rice. He also called the airlines just to confirm if we will get vegetarian food in Hindu meal. The customer executive said Its Hindu meal it will be vegetarian. When we got our food in our flight, we saw chicken pieces under the rice and we called the flight attendant, she said she is confused as she even thought the same,  hindu meal is vegetarian. And they were out of vegetarian meals too. For our entire flight to Jeddah, we were served only one entree meal. They didnt have snacks too.

✅ Trip Verified | I booked an economy ticket from Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore. I upgraded my seat because of health issues. When I upgraded my seat from Amsterdam to Brisbane I was charged 3.958 euros for the upgrade of my flight from Amsterdam to Brisbane. My husband also upgraded his seat from Amsterdam to Singapore on the same flight and was charged 1.217 euros. Singapore Airlines decided to overbook the flight. When I arrived in Singapore I found out that my seat was given to someone else. I could not fly business class to Brisbane. They gave me me an economy seat. The service was very slow and unprofessional. I asked about the refund. Only 10 days later after sending several emails to Singapore airlines, requesting more information regarding the refund, they told me I would receive a refund of only 1.545 euros. When I upgraded my seat from Amsterdam to Brisbane I was charged 3.958 euros for the upgrade. My husband also upgraded his seat from Amsterdam to Singapore on the same flight and was charged 1.217 euros. Based on these fees, I expected a refund of 2.741 euros (3.958 - 1.217). I believe that customers who are affected by this issue deserve a quick and a fair and reasonable refund. The offer I received does not meet this standard. On top of this: When I arrived in Brisbane, my luggage had not arrived. They told me the luggage would arrive in the next plain , the next morning at 7.00 O’clock. They would make sure my luggage would arrive at my accommodation the same afternoon. When I phoned to get more information I could not reach any one. I send several emails and received no reply. After numerous phone calls I finally spoke to someone. He told me that my luggage would not be delivered that same afternoon (although it had actually arrived that morning at 7:00 in the morning.

✅ Trip Verified |  We flew LHR - SIN and SIN- LHR in December. Both flights were the morning A380 flights in Premium Economy. So we’ve had best part of 27 hours experiencing the Premium Economy product. Boarding for both flights was painless. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early. The premium economy cabin on the A380 is right at the front and as such feels quite exclusive. Indeed there are only about 40 seats in the cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration. To keep this review brief. The seats were a major upgrade on the usual economy seats both in comfort and space. The food was lovely - we used Book the Cook for all our meals. Plenty of drinks brought around and if you needed a top up or a snack this was provided promptly. Again on both flights the cabin crew were amazingly good. We paid about £600 each extra over and above the economy fare, which at the time of booking meant our premium economy fare was double the economy fare. So an extra £300 each way to be in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Well yes it is , but I add a proviso. It’s worth paying extra, as long as the extra you pay is no more than around £600-£700 for long haul return. £600 economy vs £1200 Premium, that a no brainer. If you have the cash then do it. But £600 economy and £1600 Premium, then I’d personally say that’s too much for what you get;"""cabin crew were amazingly good""";"

Not Verified |  Singapore Airlines is by far the best airline I have flown it. The cabin is a spacious 3-3-3 layout in it's Economy Class with excellent mood lighting. The cabins lack individual air vents and can make it uncomfortable sometimes. Food was average and the portions were not great. However, the cabin crew do everything from serving snacks like sandwiches, cup ramen, chips, cookies, etc. to the passengers from time to time with water and beverages. Hospitality was five-star. From the welcome at the door, the crew help out passengers with a smile. Given that they work for hours together on some ultra-long haul flights and with a wide of array of passengers onboard, it is amazing to see them help you with a smile, always. In seat entertainment had a lot of options and can easily entertain any person, young or old, on a 17 hour flight. In all, the experience was great and I would recommend SQ to everyone.;"""Hospitality was five-star""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Have heard great things about Singapore Airlines, so decided to give it a try. Booked a long haul flight. Even though it's almost 17 hour flight, but didn't feel like one, when my journey ended I was as fresh as when I boarded the flight. Silverkris lounge at Changi Airport was good. They have sleeping pods as well as a bathroom, where you can take a shower, in case you feel like one. Food was amazing. They have the facility called - ""Book a Cook"", which I'd used for getting my Steak. (Attached the pic), it was so delicious and perfect as if I'm dining in a restaurant. Crew were polite and very helpful. Only drawback that I find is - at New York (JFK Airport), they don't have a nice lounge. Lounges, they have partnered with were so small and didn't have a nice quick bite / snacks or drinks. Wish they could do something about it.

✅ Trip Verified | I miss the pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately, the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own company's baggage policy (see pictures below) and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future.;"""miss pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Was this a memorable flight? Not really. I like the entertainment selection. The seat was fine for just over a 2 hr flight on SQ177. Actually not much different to the 350-900 medium haul except maybe the adjoining two seats in the middle are closer. The food. Oh my. Dreadful. Sounded great, lemongrass chicken. It was very fatty and unpleasant. The bok choy was almost raw. I would have preferred a plateful of the garlic bread instead of the tiny slice I was given. All in all it was a very average experience. I miss the Singapore Airlines pre Covid and really think they need to up their game in the food area especially. I booked this flight as at the time it was actually cheaper to go to HCMC via Singapore than just to Singapore. However, I wish I booked through Vietnam Airlines and saved money and connection hassles.;"""a very average experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Overall an ok flight. Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn’t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident. Also disappointed that when I booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350-900 medium haul.;"""crew really are the highlight""";"

On my flight from Singapore to New York , one stewardess specifically, Belle, made my 19 hour long trip with my brother an absolute delight. She was attentive, kind, and went above and beyond. When I asked if I could skip the appetizer meal (since it was a food I generally do not like) she asked if I would like fruit instead to replace it. She also would always quickly and kindly help me make my seat into a bed! (The seat form was a 8 for comfort but the bed was SOOO nice I slept for most the flight). This was the first time I had ever traveled Business class and I felt like royalty.  Even the bathroom was nice with amenities like a hairbrush. My one feedback for improvement would be to automatically give things that are included (I had to ask for slippers and mask on my flight from Singapore to NY but it was laid out from NY there) but even that was still good. While the wifi isn't strong enough for videos, it was good for surfing the internet which is what I used it for, and I charged my phone so I left with full battery.;"""best airline I have ever been on""";"

"Not Verified |  A thoroughly pleasant experience, bearing in mind this flight was during the height of Covid-19 and New Zealand had just reopened its borders. Check-in was a bit truncated, given the amount of documentation required and the person managing our check-in was receiving training. Once on board the experience was delightful, food and beverage service was lovely, including signature Singapore Slings. The A350 was very clean, and I particularly like the additional screen on the handset. Legroom was adequate, though better than many others; that said, the flight only had 75 passengers, so my wife and I had a row to ourselves.";"""the experience was delightful""";"

Not Verified |  Disappointing flight from Singapore to Auckland. A good seat, tasteless food and the worst Illy coffee i have had. What concerned me the most is the cost we paid for these flights, this one one of four flights we took on Singapore airlines over the last three weeks. The Auckland to Singapore flights seemed understaffed, whereas the Singapore to Bangkok flights seemed a lot more organised and a better food selection. ;"""A good seat, tasteless food""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The flight seemed quite full with huge line up at the gate security area. No priority line but that’s ok. Boarding was odd with just a gate agent yelling out instructions. The seat was fine but no bottle of water which was disappointing. We used book the cook. My husbands beef cheek was tender but my steak was too tough to cut or even bite into. The crew were lovely but disorganised. The right side of the plane were offered bread after the meal not before. My side missed out entirely. Arriving at Ho Chi Minh city, no priority line for immigration. Never mind. It was a 5 flight. Nothing special.;"""It was a 5 flight""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  They cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight, and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change. Their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call, something that could have been done online for free, but they found it necessary to call. They even didn't offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on Singapore Airport. Their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution. After trying to get in touch with them it took 1.5 month to get a reply saying they don't care. Also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure. My inflight food was very bad, and in-flight service almost non-existent. You had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks. In-flight entertainment was good with many recent movies. I will never fly again with Singapore Airlines after this.;"""My inflight food was very bad""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Full flight. Check in was busy, business class full. The lounge in Melbourne was okay, bit old and dated but the food was good. Boarding protocol was strictly adhered to. We were warmly welcomed. This medium haul aircraft was far different to the A380 in business. The seats although adequate were so much smaller. I was surprised to see not only a blanket and pillow but slippers, face mask, socks and amenity kit on my seat. The storage bin overhead is very high up and 158cm me needed help to stow my bag. Not much storage at the seat, just under the footstool and a tiny cubby hole once the headphones and water are removed. The staff were very friendly but reactive rather than pro active. They didn’t check the cabin during the flight but would respond to pushing the button for an attendant. The food was okay. Nothing special, steak was tough but the dessert was lovely (cheesecake). Entertainment was pretty good, quite a lot of choice, and the flight map was excellent. The refreshment before landing was not nice, chorizo and pasta. Quantity not quality. We arrived slightly sooner than scheduled. Altogether it was good for a day flight but not sure it will be comfortable enough for an overnight flight.;"""seats although adequate were so much smaller""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Check in at Brisbane was the worst we have ever experienced. There is only one business class counter, which resulted in a 30 +minute queue. On taking this up with the duty manager I was told this is to push passengers to use the check in machine and deal with their own luggage. Fine for passengers familiar with the system, but not acceptable for passengers who predate the automated era, and certainly not acceptable having paid for business class. Having finally checked in it was another disappointment to discover that Brisbane Airport has abolished fast track security. Obviously an airport decision but it begs the question, as a major user of Brisbane, have Singapore Airlines put any pressure on the airport to reintroduce this facility. The lounge had a good selection of food Once the flight boarded it was back to the excellent service we expect. So unfortunate that a good flight was spoiled by an awful start - the business class experience should begin on first arrival at the airport.;"""a good flight was spoiled by an awful start""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Seat 32A could not be reclined so it defeated the purpose of paying extra for premium economy for a comfortable seat. Seat 32C took so much effort to force it to recline. The buttons did not seem to do anything. I had to push to force it to recline. My Singapore Sling was overly sweet and it felt it was made deliberately to avoid asking for a second one. No warm towels and a small packet of nuts given quite a while after the drinks service was completed. There was a great movies/tv selection. The noise cancelling headphones were the large ear encompassing ones. Two small bottles of water were sitting in between the seats. When we boarded at the appropriate announcement time based on sections, our cabin was full so most people had boarded earlier. The economy class cabin had many empty seats. On reflection, had I had knowledge of seat bookings, I would have opted for economy. Premium class was not delivered. I asked for an amenity bag and the flight attendant looked at me puzzled, as though one such a thing did not exist. Reluctantly an economy class bag with just socks and toothbrush was procured. Food was same as economy although I pre-ordered mine. No dessert on the tray but a small tub of Hagen Daez ice cream. It seems they were anxious to get meal service done as quickly as possible. The flight attendants were friendly on boarding but we hardly saw them after the meal service. No mid-flight snacks. Plane left and arrived on time. Overall I will seriously reconsider premium economy.;"""seriously reconsider premium economy""";"

Not Verified |  (Two separate return journeys, different equipment). Pretty well can't be faulted. E.g. the airline staff went the extra mile in several respects, including luggage which didn't make a tight connection, but which I still got in 24 hours. The A350s are somewhat more comfortable in feel than even the A380s, the IFE on both aircraft is good, though the A350s have a live BBC news feed I can recommend.

✅ Trip Verified |  SQ171 DAD-SIN. Terrible flight. Boarding started late and was chaos, with no real explanation about the delay. Upon boarding could not use the overhead above my seat, and was not allowed to have any personal items. There was a Headphone shortage. Took off, and inflight service started rather late. Cabin attendants speaking extremely fast, and I was unable to comprehend what they were saying. Multiple times, Had to ask them to slow down. They ran out of food. Offered Entrée was disgusting, and I refused. They came back, and tried to offer me the Business Class entrée, but there was only 1 choice. I passed, but they hounded me with endless questions. Landed, and couldn’t get access to my luggage. Singapore Airlines is only good on Ultra Long Haul flights. With Asian connections not anymore, since they got rid of the A330. ;"""offer me the Business Class entrée""";"

They were less proactive with coming around with drinks during the flight compared to my previous flights, but responded to individual requests made to them directly.

✅ Trip Verified |  My first flight post-pandemic and Singapore Airlines lived up to high expectations. The cabin crew were excellent and made regular drinks runs throughout the flight with trays of water, juice and sometimes beer. I was impressed by their professionalism, politeness and friendliness throughout the journey, despite having to serve almost a full flight. Flood (including snacks in between meals at the galley) was plentiful, even for economy class. Two free hours of wifi for economy class passengers was a welcome addition to the service. Everything went smoothly, from boarding to disembarking. Prior to the flight I had called the call centre to make a booking amendment and the service from the call centre was also efficient.;"""lived up to high expectations""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore Airlines ranged from excellent to good. Syd-Sin-Cph (Oct 6, 2022) was excellent. Of course in Economy we were packed like sardines, but the tin was large enough (and neighbours small enough) that we weren't particularly uncomfortable. This is the third time we've flown post-Covid. The first time on Thai it seemed that Covid was the excuse to give no service at all but Singapore Airlines both at Xmas 2021 and last month provides excellent service. Food was very good and alcohol plentiful. The entertainment system provided enough to occupy us for this long haul. Flight attendants were very attentive. We stopped over in Singapore on our way home. Unfortunately Sin-Syd leaves shortly after midnight. The flight was delayed and it was after 1am before we left. This is a long time between meals and we were uncertain whether we'd be given a snack and night cap before going to sleep but no announcement was made and we stayed in limbo between sleeping and waking for most of this leg. Of the four legs of our journey this is our only complaint.;"""provides excellent service"" ";"

✅ Trip Verified |  SQ23 in Premium Economy Solo Seat.  1730 Arrived at The counter. Instantly was approached, and greeted by a extremely professional gentleman, Asking which flight I was on. When I told him SQ23, he asked “could you please wait?”. Well I went to get water, came back, and instantly he reengaged me, stating the counter was ready for me, and took me straight to the head of the line. Check in fast, with agent verifying information. Boarding was quick. Upon boarding a Red Uniformed Cabin Attendant welcomed me aboard, and directed me to my seat. As I passed others they acknowledged me and welcomed me aboard. One even said “Happy Thanksgiving”. Aircraft seemed extremely cold, and rather uncomfortable. We seemed to be late pushing back, and The Red Uniformed staff was going around talking to passengers. She approached me, and began to engage in conversation. She thanked me for flying SQ for 14 years. Finally we Took off. I had to use the provided blanket. Champagne is back on the menu. When they arrived with Dinner, they ran out of food, so the Steward said he had to go to Business to get entrees. He came back and said what he had. I ordered the Beef. He kept checking in, with estimated time of completion. Constant Champagne rounds followed through the flight. After dinner I slept. Standalone seat extremely comfortable, and excellent value. Second meal came out. I had the Stir Fry Shrimp which was Delicious. Constant Champagne refills continued. On approach to Changi, I switched to Coffee, which also continued with multiple rounds. Arriving in SIN on Thanksgiving morning, crew wished us well as we debarked. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008.

✅ Trip Verified |  I'm a vegetarian, the food was tasty but I have some thoughts: a bun served with butter without any addition in one of the main meals? I had to ask for a drink because the service  walked by multiple times ignoring me. I flew with them 4 times, two flights of 14.5 hours plus 2 shorter flights on 1 out of 4 flights, I can say that the service was at a high level. The seats were super uncomfortable. The number of drinks served for 14.5 hours is really poor. The last drink I asked for was water, and the staff brought me a tap water. ;"""seats were super uncomfortable""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Late evening check in was surprisingly busy, but with all counters open there was not much delay. Similarly the lounge was busy. There was a decent selection of food, but the wine on offer was disappointing. Boarding was prompt with a friendly welcome, and champagne and fruit juice on offer before take off. Drinks were served immediately after take off, and it seemed that most passengers opted for sleep rather than food. The seats are very comfortable for sitting and relaxing, but in the lie flat position the recess for the feet is restricting. There were four breakfast type food options available, to be served immediately or before landing, which made a lot of sense, but the Continental breakfast was very basic and disappointing. Brisbane airport was very quiet early morning, and immigration and luggage delivery very quick. Overall it was a good flight, and the cabin crew were excellent, as expected on Singapore Airlines.;"""the cabin crew were excellent""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  I wanted to change my flight ticket on 20th of April and was rushed to send a confirmation for a flight change before 21st April which involved a payment of 300 SGD which I agreed to. Upon calling back a few days later after checking that my flight has not been booked over the website, the agent over the phone tried to salvage the situation by insisting that my original flight change booking flight was cancelled and instead, I now would have to pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change. There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the ""cancelled"" flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed. I tried calling on multiple occasions and even though Singapore Airlines admitted their fault for messing up my booking, they would not change my flight at the original price that was agreed upon. As a result, I had to miss my other travel plans to London.  My main issues are these: 1) After rushing me to confirm the flight changes before 21st April, which I did on 20th April, why was the flight not booked at the original agreed price of SGD 300. Is it a lack of competence that your staff can't operate a computer? ";"""pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters seat was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying air freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would. The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened. It's not so much what happened, it is more the absolute denial that it even took place.;"""denial that it even took place""";"

Not Verified |  Check in was quick and efficient as expected with Singapore Airlines. Lounge access was the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse, which at that time of day seemed to be devoted to SQ passengers. Lounge service was excellent, with a good selection of food and drinks. Boarding was on time and very efficient, with a personalised welcome on board.. settling in was very easy, as there is so much storage available at the seat and above. Pre take off drinks were offered, but only fruit juice and water, no champagne. No amenity kits offered except by request. Food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off, and serve with sosatie appetisers. Meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains. Book the Cook is not available ex Johannesburg, and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu, it is not possible to order. Not a problem for us, as we were near the front. Decent wines were on offer, although a somewhat limited choice. Food was good, as was the service. The seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most. Flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed, which is easily done, although attendants were quick to help. The drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed, although in use this was not a particular problem, and wwe both slept for most of the flight. Breakfast was offered as and when people woke, and arrival in Singapore on time. As usual immigration was a breeze. Our only downside was we found the entertainment system difficult, but this is probably an age thing. Overall a very good flight;"""Overall a very good flight""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  No staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass. I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue, several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up, many travellers (probably first and business class) cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first.  From what I feel, they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked, they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster, it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that, many people who were already served, they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350, it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to pre-pandemic time.;"""I was not offered a drink""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney - Amsterdam - Frankfurt -Singapore (stopover) - Sydney. All flights were up to the 'old' SIA standards of service. Check-ins and transfers were easy and the lounges were clean and well-stocked. Meals ordered online and were tasty and well presented with plentiful beer, wines and spirits offered with them and during the flight - possible a little too enthusiastically. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and made the flights very pleasant indeed. You do need to ask for amenity kits and slippers if you want them and the absence of an offer of hot towels was initially disappointing but a plentiful supply was discovered in the wash rooms for self-serve. The lie-flat beds were made up by the crew if you showed any hesitation in figuring out how they worked and were comfortable once you became used to the idea of sleeping on a bed where the lower half was offset to the upper half. Cabin WiFi worked OK and the IFE seemed to have a reasonable selection, although eating and sleeping were my preferred options on the overnight flights. All in all, SIA seems to be back with their reputation intact.;"""back with their reputation intact""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Still my favorite airline. Best Economy Class !, spacious seats with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid (same excuse to save money and weight, a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was an icecream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first. IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use.

Boarding was orderly despite the fact that there were many passengers (our A380 flight that night was almost full). On board, the seat looks nice and comfortable, though one of the windows is blocked by the seat design. Staff were nice and attentive, something you would expect from SQ anyway.

For an extremely protracted amount of time, I stood in line, and finally got checked in, just before the Station Manager mustered everyone, for the evening brief, pausing check in. Boarding commenced 15 minutes late.  No boarding by rows, just a mass exodus. Upon boarding the Cabin Attendant at the door, was the sole person to welcome me onboard. IFE finally got upgraded, and the A380s fixed shellback seat was extremely comfortable. Upon taking off I dozed off, and was waken up by Cabin Crew to close my window shade. No initial drink offered to me. I requested Chicken for dinner, and the Gentleman said he had to come back. 15 minutes later, I hit the call button, and when the young lady I arrived, I explained to her I did not receive dinner. Finally the Gentleman returned, apologized, and ensured dinner would be out shortly, which it was. Followed by a second round of drinks. Woke up to a refreshment, of extremely small Sandwich of sorts, and a quick round of drinks. Arrived at FRA, and off to my connection. With all my hours, flights, and years flying with Singapore Airlines I will try to brush this off, and hope a repeat of this experience will not happen again.;"""JFK check in a disaster""";"

Premium Economy includes plastic glasses, only two wine choices (Red or White) only one glass was offered per passenger and the food offering economy standard. Neither of the above are consistent with the airline’s advertised offer. The were no masks/socks offered. The A380 Premium Economy seats are much poorer design compared to the A350 seat in the same class/airline. Hard vinyl covered seats, impossible to get comfortable in. Booked a window seat but impossible to lean against the window as seat is 200mm from window.

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Singapore Airlines last year and one thing I will say is that the friendliness of the crew is outstanding. However the seat space felt slightly cramped and the seats weren’t very comfy. I feel like the lower back support isn’t very good and this makes you sit in a position that is uncomfortable. I say this both for the A350 & A380. I am comparing this to my last journey with Singapore on an older 777-300ER, which in my opinion feels more spacious and the seats feel i lot less cramped. Also the lower back support is better. The meals, are okay by all means but when i compare this to Emirates or Qatar, they are very basic in the sense that all you get is a main dish, bread, crackers, cheese and a small desert of some kind. Nothing to shout about considering this is a top airline. The crew, outstanding on all flights I've been on, friendly and you can take your water bottle and keep filling it up. If you want a drink at any point you can go up and ask.  Transit, probably one of the easiest airports to transit through. A pleasant experience, and if you have in excess of 4 hours you can occupy yourself with plenty. Overall i think i will fly again with Singapore Airlines but might try a different airline on my next journey to the UK.;"""A pleasant experience""";"

Not Verified |  Short answer: extremely dated and old aircrafts, unpleasant ambiance, cramped seats and broken seats, closed toilets, subpar food. Good attitude of flight attendants. Long answer. The last time I flew SQ was back in 2006 and do remember that it was a very pleasant flight. Since then mostly have been flying Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and many EU/American airlines. First impression, the ambiance of the aircraft is very unpleasant when comparing it to Emirates or Qatar. IFE is small screen with limited choices. No amenity kit of any sort - zero. There was a blanket and a pillow though. One of the toilet from LA to Singapore was closed with an Out of Order note on it, so basically keep waiting for your turn. Food quality is really terrible compared to Emirates/Qatar. No salad or fruit. During the flight no water service. I am used to sitting on 15 hour Dubai flights but never get such pain as this time on Singapore. It is basically now a budget airline but with a 5 star price tag. Even the business class seats look tired and dated. Won't recommend unless you have no choice.;"""extremely dated and old aircrafts""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Great to be flying with Singapore airlines again!  Pre Covid my wife and I had always flown with Singapore airlines and were interested to see whether the high standard of care that we were used to still existed in the post Covid world. The answer is yes. The food was great and its delivery well timed. The entertainment options were excellent with a menu to meet a wide variety of tastes. We were seated in the rear compartment so were able to see the staff at work. The staff we saw were: CS Alvin, LSS Mei, LS Aslam, FSS Chia, FSS Ng, FSS Foo and FSS Chee. They did not stop working for the whole flight yet they were always caring and courteous, going to every length to meet the passengers’ needs. They are great ambassadors for their company. Wherever possible, we would always choose to fly with Singapore;"""would always choose to fly with Singapore""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  SQ033 from San Francisco to Singapore in what was sold a premium economy. Apart from slightly larger seat there is nothing to distinguish from regular economy. Very cramped in 2-4-2 seating. No champagne for take-off on 15-hour journey, no amenities, not even hand cream in the bathroom. In addition the entertainment system was bizarre — if you aren’t a fan of Tom Cruise or superheroes you are out of luck. Seriously, there was nothing to watch. Could not comment on the dinner as we chose to eat in the airport. Breakfast was okay for an economy class meal but coffee was not good. I paid a substantial premium for this and I am not impressed. ;"""I am not impressed""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Order special meals from through their apps. In the flight, I was not served with the chosen special meals, and asked the flight attendant to check. She said that all special meals has been handed out.  I had to write a email via the help section to double confirm what's the reason behind this. I was told via email that special meal was not able to be catered on the said flight due to insufficient preparation time. Truly disappointed with these behavior. There is no inflight entertainment for 2.5 hours flight, and the standard inflight meal is small in portion. ;"""all special meals has been handed out""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I booked all my flights through the Singapore Airline website.  My flight from Edinburgh to Germany (LH965) with Lufthansa booked by Singapore Air was delayed which meant I missed the next 2 connecting flights Frankfurt - Singapore (SQ2151) and Singapore - Sydney (SQ325). I understand things like this happen and with hopes of being put on the next available flight I tried to let it not bother me I arrived at the airport no one with Singapore Air was there to help so I spoke with Lufthansa who put me in a hotel for the night which was nice but didn’t have any aircon in 40 degreases heat. I was told that Singapore Air would be in contact during the night when their customer service team opened to put me on the next flight. I was up most of the night anxiously waiting for the message of my next flight in case I missed it I was on an online chat with someone who said “I will help now” but then would just end the chat. I decided to head to the airport as it was now around 9 am with no contact by anyone and I had a wedding to make on Friday the 5th. I arrived at the airport and no one cared and didn’t even want to give me the time of day. Singapore Air said it was Lufthansa’s fault and Lufthansa said it was Singapore Air’s fault the walk time to each desk was around 15-20 mins and I was back and forth with everyone sending me to random desks for 3 hours. I was told there were no flights for 3-4 days and there was nothing I can do and it was my responsibility to pay for the time I’d need to spend in Germany, I’m a solo female aged 25 and was even refused to receive my case so had no clothes to wear.  I checked Skyscanner and there were flights leaving that day, at this point, I had enough and went to the business class desk and demanded that I be put on this next flight that I repeatedly lied to that had no space.I was finally helped by someone and was easily put on the flight. Obviously, the extra leg room seats were taken which was understandable so I need to receive a refund for this. ;"""said it was Lufthansa’s fault""";"

Not Verified |  Great flight! I arrived yesterday morning in Amsterdam after an almost 13 hours trip from Singapore with my wife and small son. Flying in the business class of Singapore airlines was an amazing experience. The seat is very convenient. In the night the crew prepares a bed for you which was fine. I ordered before the flight the lobster which was absolutely delicious. The service during the flight was great. The crew was very nice to my son and us. The breakfast was also ok.

The red-eye flight was delayed by 1,5 hour and at the gate SQ organised a buffet where one could get a hot meal, able to choose between vegetarian on with chicken.

"✅ Trip Verified |  SQ is one of my favorite airlines, but unfortunately in-cabin experience is less. Still great inflight entertainment (among the best in the industry) but food service is being downgraded.  The round of drinks before dinner/lunch on longer flights, the appetizer on the tray and the hot towel upon boarding are gone. Of course nothing really serious, but with what you pay extra to fly with SQ it is an issue. Check-in process in FRA was efficient (as always with SQ) and the transit in SIN was a little tedious, as Germany (origin of my journey) was Covid-listed again: therefore it was not permitted to ""walk freely around"" the airport in January 2022 and I had to wait for my connection in a ""reserved quarantine area"". On the shorter flight to JKT you get now a box with (very) hot food, which is a downgrade compared to what you got before but still is quite ok.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Checkin in Istanbul fast and efficient. Turkish Airlines lounge just amazing; something SQ could learn from looking at its „upgraded“ new Krisflyer Lounge in Terminal 3 in Singapore. Boarding in Istanbul was well organized. Seat spacious and comfortable. Food decent, but unfortunately no Book the Cook service ex Istanbul. The big negative point of this flight was the service. Painfully slow, but still hectic and robotic. The lunch service took almost 3 hours. It took an hour from the Satay serving till the appetizer was served. No dining on demand like the ME carrier. Out of the 10.5h flight, almost half of the time was spent with meals. What happened to the previously famous Singapore girl? SQ service does not have the perfection of Qatar, nor the efficiency of LH. Krisflyer lounge in Singapore was so crowded that I left after a while. Shorter flight from Singapore to BKK was uneventful, with a faster service, but still robotic impersonal service.";"""lunch service took almost 3 hours""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The aircraft used for this short 2 hour flight is the regional business class configuration with 1-2-1 layout. For solo travellers, the window seat is the best option and is arranged in an alternating manner with seats next to the window and next to the aisle respectively. The problem with the seat next to the window is that the winglet of the seat partially obscures the window so you will have to lean forward to look out of the window. On this morning flight I ordered Nasi Lemak for breakfast and it was delicious. Cabin crew were attentive and even for such a short flight the leading stewardess addressed me by name. Overall it was a pleasant flight even though I only had 20 minutes to lie flat before preparation for landing in Singapore.;"""it was a pleasant flight""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on the new business class product of SQ on their narrow body B737-800 Max to Phuket last month. The new product featured a fully flat reclining seat in a 1-2-1 configuration. For a 90 minute flight, I had a dinner of beef steak which was booked through the Book the Cook service. As expected with steaks on airline menus, the steak was a bit too well done for my taste. As it was a short flight, it was time to descend after the dinner service. I didn’t get to try out the full recline of the seat but it was comfortable with generous pitch in lounge mode. I would definitely recommend the B737-800 Max business class product for regional routes on SQ especially on the longer regional flights of 4-5 hours where you can get a short nap in full bed mode.;"""recommend the B737-800 Max business class""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with Singapore Airlines from Brisbane to Greece recently and they lost my luggage. The suitcase was returned to me at the end of my holidays (3 weeks later) and caused me to have to change holidays plans, lots of frustration trying to reach someone form the company and incurred unexpected expenses as I landed with no personal belongings. I've sent two separate feedback forms and there has been no reply and when I managed to finally reach someone from their call centre service, they did not know how to help me and put me on hold for half an hour. This is ridiculous customer service for a company which is supposed to be among the best in the world. ;"""they lost my luggage""";"

The planes were spotless and comfortable, and the IFE selection was excellent - lots of new releases as well as plenty of art house movies. Sadly no pre-meal drinks run anymore though. And the food, whilst of good quality, seemed rather small and there wasn't that much on the tray; I also wished there were more Singaporean options available - because when there are, they are delicious.

Not Verified | London to Bali via Singapore. Having not travelled overseas for sometime due to the pandemic, I eventually got back to flying in April/May 2022 and it was so nice as I had normally taken a flight on average 20+ times a year prior to the pandemic. Check in was quick and polite checking my PCR result for entry to Bali security was quick and the Singapore Airlines lounge at Heathrow was okay. Boarding was more or less on time the seat as normal on SQ comfortable for the 12 hours flight. The crew where all pretty nice although I sensed perhaps not the normal expected on SQ, the food service was just okay good enough but again not really SQ standard that said the flight was fine. Arrival in Singapore on time I headed to the lounge to wait my connecting flight which was packed with little seating although I managed a shower. SIN-DPS was on the newer 787-10 which I really enjoyed nice crew food okay. I returned DPS-SIN in economy class again on the 787-10 and I was impressed great aircraft nice crew and the economy food box just fine for a 2 hour flight, I obviously like SQ and will continue to use hopefully service will improve as things return to normal;Singapore Airlines customer review;"

✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore Airlines no longer the same, my food tray was near empty. I had chicken noodles, that's about it with a bread. Food was no better from Melbourne to Singapore.

✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was smooth. No welcome-drinks offered, after request I got one. A narrow business-class seat, where I felt squeezed in, a huge console on the left, which is too high to use as an arm-rest and a divider on the right with reading lights.  Sleeping for me was impossible, because the seat/bed is too narrow.  With the exception of slippers no amenities offered, I was re-assured that amenity-kits are available on request. Caesar’s Salad came without dressing and croutons were missing, too. The salad was a green salad-leaf, one in 2 parts cut cherry-tomato and two tiny bits of thinnest parmesan cheese. The 2 choices of white wine were disappointing: both Australian wines, 1 Chardonnay and 1 Riesling. My main course, pan seared salmon was dry and overcooked. The vanilla ice-cream was nice, though and the cheese platter was at least a choice of 3, but served with no grapes. No pralines offered. As for my second meal, Tom Yum Vermicelli with prawns. Again, the dish was small but I could get a vanilla-chocolate cake. The inflight program was functioning, but with little to no choices for me. Since no printed reading material was available I wanted to download some business magazines to my laptop, but was informed, that download is possible on smartphones and tablets only. ;"""little to no choices for me""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I was at the airport early and check-in was supposed to open 3 hours before departure but opened 15 minutes late with long queues for both, economy- and business-class already. No warm welcome back  by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canapés I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own – another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its ‘wine connoisseurs’ – but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years’ single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesn’t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers,  I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid. But now, with all the service and amenity-cuts it’s time to say goodbye.;"""service and amenity-cuts""";"

I had to reach Australia earlier than rebooked date. I called the customer line and explained. They charged me to rebook me to a flight to Sydney as they had no other options available to fly me to Darwin. They did not give me a ticket from Sydney to Darwin and I lost a lot of money.

The flight comfort was okay but a big decline in their overall customer care. ;"""cancelled my flight for operational reasons""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  After 2 years of not being to fly with them, finally I made it! I was luckily to be chosen to upgrade from PE to J at a very attractive price last minute. It was money really well spent! It was wonderful to step into their premium cabin again, and experienced their excellent seat with many modern features. Their cabin crew are still amongst some of the best in the airline industry. I was greeted warmly and had excellent service from start to end. Having learnt that I was to go to Singapore to visit families and celebrate my birthday, they surprised me with a cake and some inflight goodies, that truly made my day! Personally, on this route, I did not see any decline in quality of meals and service. Except, maybe the lack of welcome drink, hot towels, which is excusable for covid reason. Meals are still served in separate courses, and with wine, which is constantly refilled. J class passengers, even upgraded ones like me, get 100 MB free WiFi, which was generous and very handy.;"""cabin crew some of the best"" ";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I recently flew to/from SFO in Business Class and it was not worth it. On the surface, customer service seemed normal but it was a far cry from the past and not worth the extra money to upgrade from Economy Premium. If you are short like me, sleeping in the cubby hole, in a flat position is fine. Getting the seats up/down is a ridiculous exercise requiring assistance. Not the least bit convenient. It took 4+ hours for the flight staff to get my audio working. Food was some of the worst yet. Trying to get a glass of wine refilled was arduous. Because of all the stories of airline cancellations and delays, I did not risk flying from PDX to SFO with a short layover. Certainly 5 hours was sufficient. Because of the lame check-in policies and process for getting a boarding pass, I was forced to wait 3+ hours for the Singapore counter to open.  The United Lounge at SFO was great. On the flight, it was more of the same, as in the flight to SFO. In addition to the wait for a rest room, no amenities (like socks or travel kit) was offered to me. I will think long and hard before flying their Business Class again.;"""it was a far cry from the past""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Check-in was fast, because I could use the business-class check-in counters as a PPS-member. Otherwise endless queues. Boarding was slow because the flight was full and I boarded late with the crowds. No recognition as a Solitaire-PPS-member on board as before. Cabin crew busy with 'sorting' the passengers and their cabin-luggage to not miss our slot. Seat in a 3-3-3 configuration very narrow, seat-pitch ok (for me being 1.7m only) sufficient, however. Left channel of my speakers was not working, even after exchanging them. Internet not working on my phone, either. No help given to connect, as on earlier flights, instead 'proof' was given to me by a flight attendant that Internet was working on her iphone. Not really helpful. No reading materials. Very basic and little food-options offered in a tiny cardboard-box, 'designed for a reason' (whatever this reason may be). Very inattentive inflight-cabin-crew: As for the after dinner drink I was ignored by the them while my two seat-members got served their drinks of choice. Minimum seat-recline, similar to those in budget-airlines. No soap in washroom. No disinfectant-kits offered as advertised, I got one after request only. Wearing a mask, which is 'mandatory' was not re-enforced, a man in the middle seat was wearing his mask under his chin - no one of the crew cared. Overall the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated. The typical glass of champagne offered to me as a PPS-member when I raised my concerns did not really help, it just would have been good enough if the cabin-crew would have fulfilled their duties. Disembarking was fast and swift as well as delivery of my checked-in baggage.;"""the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated""";"

Throughout the process, they were very friendly, professional and prompt to get me a flight SQ305 back to Singapore on the same day, which departs at 1255.

✅ Trip Verified |  The second leg of my trip from Hanoi to San Francisco was on SQ032 on June 16th, and this is the flight I wish to review because my reserved seat was not honored. I was first given a seat which was totally unacceptable and I requested another aisle seat. The second seat was in the exit row directly next to the door (facing the crew jump seats). This new seat had no storage pockets since there was no seat in front, and had both monitor and tray table attached. The toilets were directly behind the crew seats giving me little if any privacy and almost no chance to sleep with the toilet traffic. It is true that this new seat had extra leg room. I was quite miserable in this seat due to the lack of privacy and I had to use the floor for my storage needs. Thank god for the snacks in the rear because the 2 meals served were pretty bad. The flight attendants were most helpful throughout the flight, but I will seriously consider my options when flying this route in the future.;"""my reserved seat was not honored""";"

After 1 and a half hours were served a curry and rice, a roll and ice cream. There were only two drinks service during a flight of more than 12 and a half hours. Our second meal, breakfast was served 9.5 hours later. Unfortunately my seat was near the galley and the door to staff quarters and the crew slammed the door nearly every ten minutes and were really inconsiderate I thought.

✅ Trip Verified |  Best aircraft in the fleet! I was a little apprehensive flying on the 737 Max8 from Phuket but this turned out to be the jewel in the fleet. A beautiful spacious modern aircraft with unusually good legroom. No need to upgrade for this short flight. The catering let the side down. OK it was a short flight but serving wet noodles in a cardboard carton is not sensible. It’s too easy to spill or splash down your shirt, not a good look. There was some turbulence after about 30 minutes and the fasten seatbelt signs came on. Unfortunately, they stayed on for the remainder of the flight even though the turbulence ended after 4-5 minutes barring access to the lavatories. SIN-LHR on an A380. A complete nightmare.  I had an aisle seat with a very large male next to me spilling into my seat space for 13+ hours. This was forcing me into the aisle space where the crew repeatedly knocked into me either rushing down the plane or bashing me with the catering trollies resulting in no sleep. There was never an apology from any of the crew. The food was only just enough with many of the previously supplied items missing. I will never use them again.;"""The food was only just enough""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  First flight on 26th April was a tatty 777-300. The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat.  The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around.

✅ Trip Verified |  SIN-EWR: Purchased a ticket, with one of the 1/6 Standalone Premium Economy Seats. Check in at Changi quick. Tried to purchase lounge access but was turned down. The gate was opened 50 minutes prior to boarding. Boarding was smooth, on what seemed to be a full flight. Seat, and adjacent stowage bin were perfect. Bin could comfortably hold my Rimowa Attaché, but not Business Class. Took off on time, flew a different route than the incoming flight. Flew asleep, Cabin Crew gently tapped me on the shoulder, to eat. Have had ANA, and EVA let me sleep, and tag my seat returning later. Meal was good, Mushrooms had lots of flavor. Two-three rounds of drinks included. Recommenced sleep, and woke up. Cabin crew appeared taking drink orders, and brought back snacks. Crew continuously smiled, were warm, and professional, throughout the flight. They continued to check in, and ensure I didn’t go empty. Second meal served, again with endless drink rounds. IFE was not up to par, with what I’ve previously experienced on Singapore Airlines. Landed at EWR on time, with my bag quickly appearing. Would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.;"""definitely fly Singapore Airlines again""";"

✅ Trip Verified | After having recently also travelled on Emirates I thought it might be interesting to compare business class on Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane, both of course, via Singapore. Both trips were 'busy' business trips where everything needed to be on time and hassle-free. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet, including on one sector (Singapore-Brisbane) when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also, Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places, especially at Frankfurt - which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the quality of the cabin staff on all sectors was absolutely superb. Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was.;"""Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Business class in the longest commercial flight: Purchased tickets in February. SQ counter at EWR, opened what I thought was rather late, considering the Pandemic. Previously at JFK, FRA their counters opened earlier. Check in quick, efficient, and no stress. Virgin Atlantic Lounge was nice, however No alcohol at that early in the morning.  We boarded on time. Upon sitting was greeted, with my Surname, and welcomed aboard. My Rimowa case would not fit in any of the spaces, and had to be stowed overhead. Airborne and I had my lunch order taken. I had the Braised Shortribs. Constant, Infinite drink rounds during the flight, with my Surname used. Over Turkey, they served the second meal, I had the Thai Chicken, lots of flavor but seemed rather small.  I sent some texts to friends and proceeded to get a few hours sleep. Landed in Changi on time, with a speedy stop in Immigration, and my case was one of the first 10 out. I Have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008, will definitely continue to fly with them.;"""definitely continue to fly with them""";"

No tooth-brush- or shaving-kits in the washrooms, instead on request an amenity-kit containing a tooth-brush-set and a pair of socks. The quality and quantity of food is lowered significantly, with cold food items covered by plastic. The cheese plate is pre-packed with 2 tiny choices. I was lucky to get as a Solitaire PPS member a second one. There was not even a slice of lemon for a good glass of tea or a simple Gin Tonic available. Wines are  offered based on red or white. Only after request, the bottles are shown. Yet, any description of the taste and the drinking experience is – thanks to the no menu. Same for food: no chance to enhancing your appetite by looking at the menu upfront, no chance to check quickly what kind of food you are enjoying right now because you need to open the digital menu – which means you have to pause the movie you are watching, search for the meal menu to finally get to the description of dishes - I did not manage to find it. No pralines are offered after the main meal anymore. No Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge available any more. No hot towels to refresh after boarding, after the meal or sleep. Chocolate (e.g. Ferrero Rocher before) on the snack-selection was replaced by cheap no-name cookies, which comes in a see-through plastic-container. The silver-kris-magazine available online only. The internet-connectivity was poor on this flight and did not work for more than 50% of the flight-time.

✅ Trip Verified | We had a very unpleasant experience with Singapore Airlines. We have originally purchased our ticket to India from Auckland to Delhi and from Delhi to Auckland via Melbourne, leaving on the 9th of April and coming back on the 24th of April. We have received an email on 11th of February that our flight SQ4235 has been cancelled from Melbourne to Auckland. We have contacted the call centre and tried to rebook our flight. We choose the option of rebooking on 31st of May from Delhi to Auckland via Singapore so we have less transfers, flight number SQ403 and SQ4281 operated by Air New Zealand. The call centre operator informed us that all the economy tickets were sold on those flights, so we have an option to purchase Premium Economy tickets by paying an extra $937.60 NZD. We were charged this amount on 6th of March. We were excited to come back to Auckland and for first time in our life in Premium Economy. Unfortunately, our excitement was totally crushed when we realized we can only board the plane in economy class upon check in online. We have tried to contact the call centre again but were unable to get hold on an operator 3 times (we totally understand the current circumstances). The Delhi Airport staff were lovely but were unable to upgrade our tickets. We don't mind Economy tickets as we normally would not upgrade our flights but, in this case, we had no other choice and were charged an extra amount for nothing. ;Singapore Airlines customer review;"

✅ Trip Verified |  My recent flights with Singapore airlines were some of the worst travel experiences I have had. We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for. However, they claim it is not their fault and is refusing any refunds. ;"""asked for a refund/compensation""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Since COVID, Singapore Airlines service has been going down and prices going up, Phnom Penh to Paris which was approximately between 2800 and 3300$ is now around 5 to 6000$. They don't give any more amenity kits or we may have to ask? Also, they do not propose anymore any drinks like Champagne before taking off. The lounge quality is also not like before, I presume Covid is an excuse for everything but we are still paying the price so what? We should accept it I presume. The quality of the company service is clearly going down, I hope they will improve that for going back to their best but before reading that they are I will certainly try another company to see the difference.;"""service has been going down and prices going up""";"

Not Verified |  I had booked this trip as a miles trip due to expiring miles, & the cash tickets for these flights were quite expensive. Since we were ROP gold members, we could use the priority counter, which has been relocated to row H at Suvarnabhumi airport, it used to be at row B. Check in was smooth, & since we were flying to Japan, the agent asked if we had filled out Japan Pass - which made us clear immigration and customs really quickly in Nagoya. During the evening, The Royal Orchid Prestige lounge was extremely crowded, however we did find a corner to ourselves far from the main food area, but close to the bar & Halal food area which had fewer options. There was more than enough food and we weren't hungry when the flight took off - so we could get more sleep. I also used a shower suite, where L'occitane liquid soap and shampoo were provided. Boarding was an absolute mess, the crew was late & some passengers did not get their documents properly checked. This was made worse by the fact that gate C1 had very little seating, and lots of passengers ended up sitting on the floor waiting for boarding. We had paid extra to get extra-legroom seats (about 50 USD each) and they were worth it. The purser suggested that I move to the empty exit row seats in the second cabin so that my mum and brother could have a bit more space and comfort. This made the flight much more comfortable for them. I hate short overnight flights, and a departure time of 00:05 wasn't great - no alternatives either. Most of the passengers were asleep before the flight even took off, but I had stayed awake to get a bloody mary from the crew - who bought me one from the galley. Pre-pandemic, Thai Airways had a policy that they would have to serve their gold frequent fliers first. I am very glad that they kept this policy & I was asked whether I would like Omelette with sausage or Shrimp Pad Thai. I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai - which was very tasty & flavourful. I jokingly asked if I could get a cappuccino - which is normally only available for business class passengers. The FA said that she would try to get one for me - which she did, & I asked to be woken up for the meal service. 2 hours prior to landing in Nagoya after some tossing and turning, I was politely awoken & had my breakfast placed on my tray. The crew were all very nice on both flights. On the return flight we flew out from Sapporo/Chitose. The contract lounge in Sapporo had little in the way of amenities or food. Boarding was much better organised on this flight, and we had our meal orders taken after being seated, stewed chicken with mash potatoes or spicy fish curry with rice. I tasted both on this flight and both were very tasty, albeit the fish used is pangas, which isn't that great. Thai used to serve seabass which tastes much better. The highlight of the meal was the cake - a simple vanilla sponge but really tasty. Before landing we were served a spinach pie, which was also tasty but I would've preferred chicken. There was a small issue I had with the crew, on this flight, I found out the tray table wasn't clean when I looked at it during boarding, & the purser walked through & told me to close it for departure - but I pointed out the wet table to her & she called one of the FAs to wipe it up. Entertainment is slightly lacking - they could do with a few more films. Thai is still a great carrier, maybe not as great as the pre-pandemic Thai Airways, I feel like they're 90% of what they used to be in 2019.;"""90% of what they used to be"" Kamapin";"

✅ Trip Verified |  How can any airline justify charging 37 pounds per kilo or 745 pounds for a standard 20kg of extra luggage? When I spoke with the Thai airways representative he agreed it was high but wasn’t able to help. I’m thankful we looked into this before as we were planning to bring an additional suitcase and pay at the airport, which apparently is closer to 60 pounds per kg.

Not Verified |  We travelled Thai Airways from Melbourne to Chennai via Bangkok and vice versa. We are still not sure on the process to book the bassinet seat and on based on what priority it can be booked. We are travelling with a 9 month old and we will have to sit with infant through out the flight. I know few airlines which provide bassinet for babies until 1 year old. We checked with customer care on the process to book the front row seat with leg space during our flight to Bangkok and they advised us to speak at the counter. At the counter they say the flight is full and asked us call and book before the flight. We somehow managed travelling to Bangkok which is a 9 hour flight with baby in our lap. We had some trouble when people In front of us push their seat back. On our return flight, we checked with them. Please note we consistently called them, no response, mailed them no response. We rang them again and the officer said she cannot book online and we call them some hours before. We did call and still we didn't get the seat. The lady in the counter said we should call and talk. End of story we didn't get seat and no staff is able to direct us on the process to book this seat. In Thai Airways only infants below 6 months can avail the facility of bassinet. I am not sure I saw babies or parents with babies in that seat. In some place they say if we pay we can get the seat. We are pretty disappointed with the service and expect parents with babies or toddlers (under 2 years get some preferences with regards to seat). ;"""pretty disappointed with the service""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew back from Paris CDG to Bangkok with Thai Airways. After so many negative comments about food and service, I wanted to show my satisfaction and my gratitude for a good flight. I arrived at CDG Terminal 2E before 09:00 am, and to my surprise the check-in counters were open very early. CDG Terminal 2E is not my favorite Terminal in Paris, Thai Airways may moved back to the iconic Terminal 1 later, but at the present time they are still using the Air France Terminal. Check-in was fast, passport controls was easy, but the security lanes took over 30 minutes. Boarding was on time and efficient.  The return journey to Bangkok was full in Business class and Economy class. The cabin crew in my section were super attentive and very responsive to my demand. I was given a a written menu, not the same as the old Business class menu, but it is a step into a better direction. The catering from Paris was excellent and very tasty and portions were very large. I ordered the Thai dish. Mid-flight the cabin crews came around and served some Thai chocolate ice-cream, a nice touch. In the galley, drinks and snacks were available. The restroom were kept clean during the flight. I was pleased by the service provided and glad to experience the Royal Orchid Service that I knew. They are making an effort to improve their inflight service. If there is one area of improvement is IFE with more movies and more music. Thank you for a memorable return flight.;"""gratitude for a good flight""";"

The flight was punctual but what I wish to comment on was the friendliness and hard work of the cabin crew who never stopped working throughout the 10 hours of the flight. I went for regular walks and coffee pick me ups and they were always polite and helpful also to the many passengers who required attention. I enjoyed the meals and having travelled with other European carriers I can say that these crews are really on top of the game.

Not Verified |  The previous flight out from LHR to BKK was ok, but this return flight from BKK to LHR was a step up. The staff were fantastic and attentive. A menu was provided and the food, in particular the duck with curry sauce was lovely. We got 2 meals. The cabin was dimmed after the meal to allow people to sleep - this daytime route is always tricky in that you end up effectively having a 31 hour day. The films weren’t particularly great although I found a couple to watch and there was nothing like live TV or sport which some airlines provide. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight. The hard product was ok, full flat bed, it pays to understand the alternate arrangement of seats close together or wide apart in the middle pair and aisle or window biased on the single outer seats. It’s not the best out there but it isnt the worst either. Pricing is relatively expensive at the moment.

✅ Trip Verified |  Definitely not flying with the airline again.  I was unable to purchase my flight tickets directly from the airline as they would not accept any of my cards. I had to resort to booking via a third party website, which meant that I could not choose a weight of my luggage. Before check-in, I tried to purchase extra weight online with my booking reference number but I was unable to do so, not even during the online check-in, so I was okay with paying kore at the airport. At Bengaluru airport, I have been told that I am unable to make a payment by card nor cash, only UPI form of payment was possible. For that though, I would need an Indian bank account. I found it ridiculous…how can they offer just this form of payment on an international flight with international travellers. Thankfully, I have friends in India who were willing to make the payment for me but what about the others? Honestly, there is zero logic! Also, it took the staff to calculate the price like 10minutes…Oh and my receipt stipulated that I paid in cash. I honestly don’t know what would happen if I could not make the payment. Thai Airways is way too problematic for me and will try to avoid it at all costs in the future. But i have to say that the staff during the flight were nice and helpful. I don’t have anything negative to say about the service provided. However, it was a night flight so most of the passengers were sleeping. Also want to point out that seats were extremely uncomfortable and I was unable to sleep well.

The check-in experience was awful. Once on board, we were greeted by Thai graciousness and got to see the lovely Thai hospitality and colors. The plane was outdated and an amenity kit with poor-quality slippers was at your seat. IFE was appalling. Wifi did not work because apparently, they had to yet arrange for the service although the aircraft was equipped with wifi. There were no menus and the staff just told you briefly what was available. Nevertheless, the meals were very good and were served with canapes, appetizers, a Thai main course, and dessert. with cheese plate Later on, coconut ice cream in the traditional Thai style was served as also Thai iced tea with black jelly.

But when confronted, this staff joined his supervisor together to claim that they confirm they won't be allowed to process issuing my connecting flight (TG638) from Bangkok to Hong Kong, unless I have a HK vaccination proof record. So they only issue the HKT-BKK ticket and insist I can confront with the ground staff at Bangkok if I am allowed to board my connecting flight in BKK (just one hour 5 minutes connecting time there). I got stranded in BKK due to the lack of this connecting flight boarding pass. When confronted at BKK Thai Airways ticket office, it took me some time to argue with the Manager of the Thai Smile Phuket Ground Staff to confirm it was their mistake and lack of updated information and following up. At last, I wasted another 6 hours in BKK and took another airline back home.;"""took another airline back home""";"

Not Verified |  As my flight was when Thailand was in lockdown i tried to find information on what to do in Bangkok as we were stopping there, I tried finding information and I tried contacting Thai airways before leaving. Absolutely impossible. They never answer to emails and they never picked up the phone after dozens of attempts. Luckily if you're a bit savvy you can find the website. But for the layman, good luck, because Thai airways ain't gonna help you. We took 4 flights with Thai in total. Out of those, my seat was broken on two of them. When I let the onboard crew know, it was like I was speaking gibberish. No care factor at all.  Credit where credit is due, at least some of the crew were very nice and accommodating. During our flight back, my bag was absolutely smashed. It was peeling all over the place and a wheel had been knocked off. As well as my wife's brand new bag was also scratched to within an inch of its life. Unfortunately we made the mistake of not properly inspecting them before going to security at Sydney airport. Because it didn't matter however much I tried to contact Thai airways afterwards, they're just as impossible to contact. I even filled out their online form the day after. And when I finally got in contact with the Thai airways cargo email at Sydney airport I got to talk to someone. Regardless, just as fruitless as everything else with Thai airways so far. Claimed that I hadn't filled out the form and that I was out of luck. So essentially, because they're having whatever issues with their shitty website, that's my fault and my bag won't get fixed. Flying is usually never fun. But this experience has been the worst I've ever had by far. And the worst part? I would've come back,  if they had just replaced my $100 bag. But Thai would rather lose two customers permanently. Couldn't recommend them.;"""Couldn't recommend them""";"

Not Verified | Thai Airways was an overall very pleasant experience. Boarding: security took half an hour but after it boarding seemed organised and it was smooth! Seat was very comfortable and a large amount of legroom. Add this with a 333 Config and an adjustable headrest and recline, it was very good for Economy class. Staff were very friendly and were greeting people nicely. Food was tender and delicious, probably one of the best economy meals I had ever had in a flight. IFE: Fair enough. The system was smooth and straightforward, but it had less shows and music on average compared with other airlines. Thai offered charged Wi-Fi at reasonable prices. Was fast enough for browsing or streaming. Definitely recommend!;"""very pleasant experience""";"

✅ Trip Verified | Aircraft had her years but was well kept. Friendly welcome, seat was standard business with pillow, blanket and amenity kit with slippers. Unfortunately, there were no pajamas. In the side socket were the earphones. There was no inflight magazine due to covid. Also there was no Menu but the crew came and explains what they can prepare for us and I made my selection. I asked for wine list but she said she will present them to me with the carriage. After while another member of the crew came with the warm towel. IFE was good, screen is big enough and the selection of the movies was a little outdated. There was no wifi option (due to aircraft?) After departure, service started. First arrived the nuts with appetizes and champagne. Then the first plate was a macaroni salad with chicken. My main dish was served which I had selected fish and she presented me the wines. I picked red (because I like, should pick white with fish). Two members of the crew came to bring the fruit with cheeses and I had to pick a red strong wine. Finally dessert with coffee and brandy was served. After that had to check the lavatory and get ready for nap. By the time I returned, my seat was turned to a bed and bedding was set for me. A bottle of water arrived to follow me to sleep. I played with the IFE and soon I was snoozed. One hour before arrival they start awakening the passengers to ready them for the second serving. It was tasty with flavor of Thailand. Another warm towel arrived and we were ready for landing. Everything was pleasant and relaxing. Great service.

Pleasant experience with nice and clean Boeing 777. Seat had a decent legroom and the seating part was moving forward giving you an extra reclining feeling. Very comfortable, on the seat was a blanket and earphones, NO pillow. Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid, (same excuse to save money and weight, a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). IFE was good but a little outdated selection of movies. I found a couple movies to keep me busy. No welcome drink offered. After takeoff service started (two option) which was tasty with selection of wine, beer and drinks. No ice-cream for desert. During flight the crew was passing by with little bottles of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks during the flight. No amenity kit and at the WC were toothbrushes and hand cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served also two options.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Nothing changes Thai airways are still awful! We arrive at the airport check in, through fast track as we are flying business, all pretty uneventful as you would expect on a premium ticket. We are flying from gate C8 and follow the signs to the Thai lounge at C Gates, a 600m walk, to find they are closed, so we walk the return journey 600m back to the lounge we passed 10 - 15 mins before, that is open at D gates. We ask why we weren’t told by the check in staff that only the lounge at D gates is open; apparently it has been shut for ages and they keep asking the check in staff to tell passengers but they don’t! Anyone at Thai airways heard of a sign? Simple 5 minute job! By the way lovely lounge, but the same awful TG service. Nothing changes. We then get to the gate to see a queue 50m long to board, no priority line for Business class passengers. Apparently they call them on first and then it is a free for all… So the business class passengers lucky enough to have made it to the lounge, who don’t arrive to be at the head of the queue wait in line, or have to push themselves to the front - embarrassing and awkward for them/us nothing changes!

The service in the Y class is kept to the bare minimum, cost cutting was apparent too in the catering area. However, they do still maintain good standards in service, and meal were decent enough despite smaller portion, on plastic cutlery. As a star alliance gold member, priority boarding, luggage delivery and excess luggage allowance were all delivered.

✅ Trip Verified |  Another airline whose reputation from the past is fading. The flight from Copenhagen to Bangkok was canceled shortly before boarding. Unfortunately, the passengers were not rebooked on other flights, but had to spend the night in a hotel in Copenhagen. The issue of vouchers for transfer and hotel accommodation was very chaotic. The flight was then operated again the next day with 1 hour delay to the scheduled departure time. Cabin crew was friendly but all other assets were below par. For example, there were no menus in business class, the amendment kit had very basic content, the IFE offered little selection of current films, liquid residue from the predecessor was still stuck to the side wall and the seat was already showing signs of wear. There was also no Wifi available. The food was all served on a tray with no tablecloth and the quality of the food was average. Gone are the days at Thai, when there was an orchid for every passenger and everything was done with a smile. Too bad. I will certainly not book business class with Thai in the near future.;"""reputation from the past is fading""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong from Delhi. At the airport, the counters were poorly organized, the worst part was the time of the registration. It took me more than two hours to register. In the end, when I was at the counter, the attendant told me I had to pay for my 6-8kg of extra luggage - almost 500$. I could not buy extra luggage online because it is down on the website if you don't fly domestically in Thailand. Also, I'm Russian, we don't have any working VISA and MasterCard cards anymore. We cannot pay for extra. The attendant did not propose I rearrange the luggage or reduce the amount of extra luggage. It was already almost 30 minutes to boarding - the attendants held me there. So, I had to pay to be able to board the plane - there was a very long line for the passport check. The flight itself was fine. Flight attendants were polite and provided me with sufficient help due to my situation. However I do not recommend Thai Airways, especially flying from India. They will take your money, and force you to exchange for rupees; the amount is ridiculous - I have never paid that much for the overweight. The amount should be reasonable. Also, the attendants should provide options for what to do in this situation and should not keep you at the counter when the boarding is almost on. I saw no politeness, no hospitality, no respect that day from Thai Airways at the airport. Also, I have filed a claim on the official website explaining everything in details - no response at all.

I would understand that dip in quality if that was the case but we are not travellers that press the buzzer (ever). We were not offered a drink with our meals, not offered tea or coffee except for once the entire flight. Meals were handed out with bottled water and that was the extent of it.

✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I travelled together back from London in business class. We had booked 2 seats together only to find out that the seat booking had been changed due to 4 business class seats being broken, so we sat behind each other. The plane was so old and even my seat had problems reclining. There was a time when getting on board you were greeted with a smile and champagne. It seems that the Thai staff have been told not to offer anything to customers - the air hostess made an excuse that due to COVID that we could no longer have champagne until after take off. Throughout the trip the staff were hiding, and very rarely came round to offer any snacks, drinks unless asked! Overall it seems that the staff are unmotivated and embarrassed by the state of Thai Airways.

This is not a huge issue and apart from misplacing the bags in the first place, the service provided to have my bags located and delivered was reasonable. However the customer service after this was appalling. I quite simply required confirmation from the airline that my luggage was delayed so I could make an insurance claim. I sent over 10 emails and made over 15 phone calls (6 hours on hold) without receiving a single emails back and after having the line cut after being on hold multiple times. When I reached out on their facebook page I received a nasty response via the messenger app accusing me of 'spaming' them. All phone numbers they provided either rang out or went on hold and were eventually disconnected without anyone picking up. It has been 4 months and I still have not heard a thing from them.;"""customer service was appalling""";"

Not Verified |  After reading so many angry review about Thai refusing to honour previously booked flight credits, we were happy just to finally board and take off after two years. We weren't surprised but still disappointed by the poor standard of food served and by the little things such as packaged towelettes instead of real hot or cold towels. It seems a miracle that the airline is still able to operate. The IFE wasn't too bad especially if you're not a regular cinema goer. Dune was a welcome addition but the line hasn't changed much over the last few years. The service by the cabin crew was excellent as always. The BKK to CDG leg had the new seat configuration where everyone is at an angle. The seat is much harder but on this flight a mattress was provided. I think I prefer the other seat type. The business class lounge at BKK was disappointing. Our flight to CDG left at midnight leaving us with a 7 hour transit. No showers were available then or 7 weeks later! The chairs were comfy for a few hours but not for a long stopover. The food options however were far better than the inflight catering. There was no business class lounge available at CDG due to renovations but I suspect it's another cost cutting measure like the soft drinks only policy prior to take off and alcohol served only during meals. Our main complaint was the number of changes made to our original post Covid booking and the terrible customer service from their Sydney office. Numerous unanswered phone calls, messages and emails.;"""still disappointed by the poor standard of food served""";"

To top that off my THAI wife got allocated 30kg of Luggage and me 20kg?

"✅ Trip Verified |  Cannot contact them by phone for rebooking; you have to do it by email (UK) -- I have done this several times and sometimes they reply after 48 hours but sometimes it takes them 5 days. They have a phone number for their Manila operations but you only get a recorded message; their Manila airport number, which the recorded message said you could call on certain days, just kept ringing. I even phoned their Bangkok number from Manila -- and just got an automated message. They blame the pandemic for this but why are some airlines able to provide good customer service despite their staff still working from home? London-Bangkok-London flight used their new Boeing 777 (with first class cabin) but I could not see any difference in economy with their older Boeing 777 (Bangkok-Manila-Bangkok). Toilets were kept clean on all legs, and because it had fewer economy seats (3-3-3), there were hardly any queues for the toilets. Food is horrible. London-Bangkok-London leg: a 12-journey we were served only two meals, ie not a hot sandwich snack in between. We were not given a choice for breakfast: on both outbound and inbound flights, we were served the same thing -- chicken sausage, scrambled eggs and potatoes. For the dinner)I had green chicken curry -- it was not that good by Thailand standards but at least I could eat it. I am not a finicky eater, and I have come to expect airline food to not be delicious. I have flown Thai two years before and had a good experience with them (good food, service), which was why I chose to fly with them again.  The flight crew were attentive, but it would be better if they could serve the drinks as they serve the meal.

When I explained the situation to the ticketing center, they told me I have to pay an additional 220USD ""no-show"" penalty for ""missing"" my flight which the counter staff hasn't mentioned to me.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The Boeing 787 looked shabby externally when it landed from Bangkok, with a very faded livery. Internally it was much the same and everything looked rather worn and unkempt, including some sticking tape holding part of the seat edge together on row 41. Washrooms were not what I would call clean. Food was so-so; two meals at start and approx. 3 hours out from London, plus a very odd tasting egg sandwich at about 6 hours in. Crew were friendly but not attentive; crew call button was never responded to on the three attempts I tried at various points throughout the flight. Mask wearing was not enforced despite several PA announcements. Garbage wasn't collected, nor were items such as blankets. In general I dislike the Dreamliner and try and avoid flying it (which is getting harder to do): 9 seats abreast feels a real squeeze in economy and the toilets are tiny and too few. The difference between the Thai 787 and the Emirates A380 and 777 on the outward journey was stark, both in terms of cabin comfort and service levels. Thai used to be great, but an obvious downgrade in service level, combined with operation of the 787 means a poorer travel experience. I'm wondering what their A380 offering is like?";"""an obvious downgrade in service level""";"

"✅ Trip Verified | Thai Airways always had subpar operations but at least they had good food, relatively spacious cabin, and smiling (if not the most efficient) staff. After the pandemic, even the few remaining strengths have now disappeared. From my experience from my last interaction I can safely say that Thai Airways as we remember it is no more. It is now one of the worst airlines in Asia. This is why - my flight got delayed but no one at the check-in counter mentioned that and there was no status change when I checked online. After waiting 3.5 hours, the flight was delayed a further 3 hours. Again, no emails or texts - just the airport screen showing the update. Then the flight suddenly got cancelled. Again no communication from Thai in this regard. No Thai staff to be seen anywhere at the Chennai airport and we could not exit the security area so no way for us to contact Thai. I made three international calls from my mobile just to connect with Thai Airways in Bangkok. The saddest part was that their customer service people said they had no way to contact their staff in Chennai. That's when I knew Thai had hit bottom. Their local phone lines are literally disconnected and the staff ""helping"" me at the airport were wearing Air India uniforms. Only airline in the world which abruptly cancels their flight but their website even after 48 hours shows the flight took off and landed on time! If I get a refund I will be lucky.";"""Thai Airways as we remember it is no more""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time flying since COVID and I was a little disappointed. The aircraft was only just over 6 years old and wasn’t in the best kept condition. Economy was quite empty on this flight. You could see that the airline had spread passengers about which was great as you have to do a PCR test upon arrival. Food was lovely I must admit. If you wanted anything outside of service it was a long wait, although staff were pleasant. No WiFi, which I was surprised at. Don’t get me wrong it’s not the bee all and end all. The convenience on a direct flight is always a key factor when flying, but I did expect better. It wasn’t horrific, but just wasn’t what I’ve come to expect from Thai Airways.;"""I did expect better"" ";"

✅ Trip Verified |  We booked our trip to fly to Chennai, India on 8th Jan 2922 and to return journey via Bangkok on 21st Jan. From Dec2021 we were contacted by Thai Airways infirming us of changing flight schedule multiple times, different versions in the morning which would be changed in the evening. Frustrated with these changes and uncertainty in their schedule we asked for cancellation. This was orally agreed. They also informed us refund will come through in 8 weeks time. We sent a cancellation request in email too. .. no response to that though. We have been chasing refund with no response, neither an email response or on phone. ;"""chasing refund with no response""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  A week ago I received an email notifying me that Thai Airway changed the first leg of my flight returning to France on 30 April 2022 with up to 14hr layover. My original flight left Phnom Penh at 21.15 pm, arrived in Bangkok at 22.55pm and connected to the following long flight to Paris departing at 00.05 am. And now the proposed change means I am supposed to leave Phnom Penh at 9.40 am, meaning 12 hours before than planned and with the prospect of spending 14 hours in the Bangkok airport waiting for my next flight to Paris! As you can imagine, this is highly crazy because I won't be allowed to leave the airport given that Thailand has one of the most restrictive covid-related policies for travellers. I wrote straight away to Thai Airways' customer service seeking for a solution and for a week they have not answered my emails. This is not admissible, please be careful with your purchases with Thai Airways.;"""be careful with your purchases with Thai Airways""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  The worst Customer service ever. I understand my flight got cancelled multiple times and I was forced to stay in Thailand for 24 hours on my expenses because my mom was getting her surgery done and I had no choice but to do that to reach to my home country on time. On my return my ticket again got cancelled multiple times, I told the customer care to arrange something for me as I have to go back and start a new job and if I will not be back on tie, I will end up losing it but I got no response at all. I sent multiple emails to customer care to organise my refund on time so I can at least by myself another ticket but they sent no response. They finally acknowledged my email and said this is wrong department and send it to Sydney customer service instead of pro actively taking its responsibility.  It has been 2 long months, I would have sent them so many email for the return of the money but they have not acknowledged me.  I will never travel with THAI again for the unprofessional behavior they have shown. I am sure there will be many people out there suffering like me because of there laid back attitude or not taking customers seriously. I have never felt so frustrated and helpless.;"""never felt so frustrated and helpless""";"

✅ Trip Verified | I flew Thai before covid and with the threat of bankruptcy cancelled most flights to Europe. I was devastated when they stopped all flights. Although some European airlines I have used are generally good (flight crews), Thai has always stood out for me for the quality of their crew and service. And a big call out to the Milan Thai customer call centre who were the best and most efficient people I talked to. Fast response, polite and proactive unlike many others. This flight on 10th February from Malpensa to Frankfurt (Lufthansa) to Bangkok was superb. The crew were attentive, courteous, professional and worked as a team. The landing as my seat neighbor also stated was gentle just like its staff. Food and alcoholic drinks were limited in choice but this is a great airline that is starting to recover. Thank you for this great experience. I am glad you are back and wish you strength and success.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My route was SYD-CPH via BKK return. With the exception of a tasty curry, every meal ranged from typical airline food (ie, quite awful) to inedible. One glass of wine with the meal was the only alcohol served.  Entertainment was hardly entertaining. Choice was very limited (eg Music channel consisted of 5 pod casts and one Thai Airways music selection). Movies were very old, no games or puzzles. The most entertaining screen was the live map which I viewed on-and-off for 19 hours. Service on first leg was very poor. Eg, when service manager was asked by a passenger if he had a pen for the disembarkation form he answered ""no"" and walked off. Other legs it was much better. No on-board duty free sales. Ground staff in CPH gave wrong information. Is this typical of Thai Airways or the new Covid airline?";"""Service on first leg was very poor""";"

"✅ Trip Verified |  2 years after bankruptcy and 2 years into COVID you would have thought TG would have taken the opportunity to address their customer service weaknesses… sadly not… flying fewer planes they are even worse than before, nothing has changed. It remains an airline run for the staff and not for the passengers. Check in was a car crash in a half built check in area. When we got to the gate, the usual performance, 1 person checking tickets, 4 people standing around looking important and a huge queue of fare paying customers going nowhere. I think it was their only international flight that evening and guess what we took off late -  nothing changes. On the aircraft, on the short hop to Phuket we weren’t offered a glass of water; interestingly the spare flight deck officer got a lovely meal, drink and attention from the crew,  people paying for the seat got nothing. The airline is awful and has made no attempt to improve itself, unless I am in an absolute emergency I will never fly with them again. ";"""I will never fly with them again""";"

Not Verified |  Honestly the worst flight (from booking through to landing) that I have ever had. Before flight needed to contact Thai Airways and all their phone lines are completely closed due to Covid. Only way to contact them is through email which they do not reply (still not received any reply after 6 weeks to an email sent before this flight) or Facebook messenger where they are unable to help with anything anyway. This fact alone should stop anyone booking with Thai Airways in the current Covid situation as if anything goes wrong that requires you to contact Thai Airways (which in the current situation is always a fairly high possibility) there is literally no way to contact them. As a comparison with my recent flight with Singapore Airlines they replied to emails within the hour, and phone calls within 2 minutes. Then the flight - Seats are the usual Thai Airways business class product. Nowhere near the best, but not bad and as expected. However for a 12 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment. Apparently due to risk of covid from people touching the screens. (Obviously that is completely different from people touching seats or trays). Far more important for safety should have been the used washbag that was still in my seat when I sat down, and the rubbish in my wife’s seat. Clearly Thai Airways cleaning measures during COVID are inferior to other airlines cleaning measures during normal times, let alone in the current situation. No WiFi. Didn't bother me as I rarely drink alcohol on planes, but for information purposes there is no alcohol available apparently due to Covid. Again for comparison Singapore Airlines inflight entertainment currently works fine. Clearly just a cost cutting measure from an airline in financial trouble. Which when paying a normal Business Class fare is just completely unacceptable. Poor quality food (economy class meal standard). Main served mostly cold. Of course being served on one tray is understandable in the situation, but what is not understandable is the pathetic quality. Again other airlines are still managing to serve good quality food. They frankly just seem to to be using COVID as an excuse to cut all costs and offer an appalling business product The only good thing that could be said about the whole experience is as usual the cabin crew were generally friendly when they were actually in the cabin. But that obviously does not make up for appalling food, no entertainment on a 12 hour Business Class Flight, no ability to contact anyone at the airline by phone to make changes to tickets (something that is actually more important during the current COVID situation, not less so), tired and worn seat, poor boarding procedures, uncompetitive carry on luggage for business class etc. Used to be a good airline (I have flown them many times before in First, Business and also Economy) but they have gone so far downhill I will never be flying them again unless I have a flight for which it is completely unavoidable. Would recommend people avoid them at all costs.;"""seem to to be using COVID as an excuse to cut all costs""";"

✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Rome in January 2020.. I used my Royal Orchid Plus gold Frequent-flier upgrade to fly business class on this flight. I had reserved the meals onboard before checking in, as Thai have a small menu for business class fliers to choose from. Check in at Bangkok airport was very well appointed, with sit-down check in desks at Row A in Suvarnabhumi Airport. Even though they’re not part of the same alliance, they even checked my luggage through on Alitalia. Private security and immigration for biz/first is such a treat, i was through in seconds. Then you’re directly down an escalator to the Royal Orchid Lounge. It’s an amazing lounge, they even include a 30 minute free massage for biz passengers, and I recommend heading to the spa first thing before heading to the lounge to reserve your spa appointment. Boarding was done by bus and stairs, and we pushed back on time. Before pushback a flight attendant came around and greeted us by name. She confirmed my meal order and asked my mum what she would like for dinner. I found out from a friend flying to Brussels that all flights to Europe get the exact same choices when he sent me a picture of his dinner. Some interesting welcome drinks were bought to you, a choice of tamarind ice tea, champagne, and a Thai floral drink I cannot remember the name of. All flights had a very light load, and I  switched seats for sleeping/eating. The first course was foie gras terrine, followed by a Thai main course which I preordered, spicy shrimp coconut curry, served with a beef pho-style broth, and steamed veggies. It was just what I wanted. Comfort food. There was a small dessert before I dozed off. Before landing the flight attendant woke me up and promptly served a plate of cold cuts and cheese, but I wasn’t full so I asked for the Thai breakfast, boiled rice soup with Shrimp and pork meatballs.  On the return flight I had a veal dish for lunch, and Thai style omelette with boiled rice soup and chicken for breakfast, the veal dish was quite exquisite but the breakfast is easily described as comfort food for me. The new dishware is quite bleak. Service on the flights were immaculate. Very prompt as you should be on a late night flight, a full meal service finished an hour after takeoff. Day flights are a little less rushed. The flight attendants are courteous and professional. The seat is very comfortable and Thai provide a mattress cover which makes the bed  more comfortable. The footwell is also quite large. Ground service in Rome was very nice, the Alitalia lounge was very good. However I’d recommend taking a detour to the D gates and going to the Star Alliance Lounge in Fiumicino Airport. It’s got very nice views of the airport. Overall I cannot fault Thai Airways product.;"""cannot fault Thai Airways product""";"

I have a doctors certificate stating I am healthy and not showing symptoms, but this isn't enough and I'm not allowed on the flight. When I then ask for a refund, Thai charge me $150 to get my refund. This is completely ridiculous as I did not choose to cancel my flight, I was not allowed on the flight!

✅ Trip Verified |  Whilst on my holiday in Bangkok, Thai Airways changed my flight from 28.3.2020 00.01 am to 29.3.2020 7.20 am changing my flight from TG483 to TG481 with no consent and no prior communication. As soon as I received an e-mail notifying me about this change, I contacted Thai airways via e-mail stating we could not fly on the 29th so the flight would have to be moved to the 25th or the 27th. I sent this same e-mail to 4 different email addresses to not receive a reply for 4 days - ended up having a reply from the Sydney office. I explained the situation and asked for the 29th flight that we couldn’t take to be moved to an earlier date with a few options and again didn't receive a reply for a another few days! and the reply I received kept stating that Thai airways would be cancelling flights from 27th march onwards. If that were the case, why couldn’t Thai airways accommodate my request of simply changing the 29th flight to an earlier date? At this point I had to book and pay for another flight departing on the 25th. I had to also call the 24 hour line multiple times to have an automated message inform me the call will drop out after 15 minutes at the same time stating the wait time was 27 minutes, I had the hotel call to try and speak to someone who knew anything and could possibly help only to be hung up on and told 'I can help you', you need to contact the Perth office when I return to Australia '. To this day I still have no reply from any of my e-mails I sent trying to correct flights from the date of change on 18 March 2020 and I had relentlessly been trying.

"Not Verified |  Bangkok to London. Pros - Check-in smooth and efficient. Comfortable seat, good friendly efficient cabin crew. Flight was smooth and uneventful. Cons - Entertainment was not as varied as some (could take lessons from Emirates, Qatar and EVA) with poor choice of music and almost all TV shows were American - don't Thai know there are very good TV shows made in other English speaking countries?. Food was tasty and hot but portions were small. No menu cards offered so, didn't know what was being served until cabin crew offered ""chicken or pork""? No mention of other items on the food tray. Mid flight sandwiches were kept in galley and not offered to seated passengers. At no point (other than meal times) did cabin crew come round offering drinks.

✅ Trip Verified |  London to Manila via Bangkok. I had the reservation to fly back on 2nd February 2020. My flight on the 2nd of Feb 2020 from Manila to Bangkok was cancelled after several hours of delays. Passengers including me were allowed inside the aircraft and made to wait for a long time before it was cancelled. We were not given proper updates while we waited at the gate to board the aircraft. Only a ground staff when I asked personally, told me that there is a fuel leak and the engineers were working to fix the problem. The departure was scheduled for 1910 hours. At around 2100 hours, we were given a sandwich each and a drink. Then, for the next eight hours (0500 Hours on 3rd Feb 2020), I had not had another drink. We were made to wait for hours for the bus to take us to the hotel. Bus took over an hour to depart from the airport. After reaching the hotel, it took another hour or more to get us into the lobby of the hotel, as we were told to remain in the bus. Some people got out to buy snacks against your staff’s instructions.  At 0500 I got into my hotel room. Breakfast was open from 6am. We were told to check out of the rooms by 2pm and the flight was supposed to leave at 5pm. We waited until 3:30pm at the lobby of the hotel to be boarded on the bus. After boarding the bus, the driver sat doing nothing. After waiting for over 45 minutes, I asked the driver, what are you waiting for. He said, airline staff. Then he got out of the bus, walked to the reception, returned in 2 minutes and drove us to the airport. There were no airline staff and there were no more passengers waiting for transportation to go to the airport. We just sat in the bus for someone to give the driver directions as what to do next. The flight departed at 1910 hours (7:10PM) on the 3rd Feb 2020, 24 hours later than it was supposed to. Never once I saw a senior Thai Airways personnel. I saw a few ground crew who were inexperienced and some unruly passengers intimidated them by their rude behaviour. ;"""Manila to Bangkok was cancelled""";"
