review;summary
Hong Kong to Brisbane via Taipei. Hong Kong to Taipei was Ok, service was reasonable. Taipei to Brisbane was uncomfortable and food selection was poor. While in Australia China Airlines cancelled the return leg Taipei to Hong Kong. I made 2 phone calls and 1 email to their Taipei office explaining that I still wanted to continue with the Brisbane to Taipei leg. Before the flight I received and email stating the refund would be HK$ 4055. At Brisbane I was advised by China Airlines staff to make my own ongoing arrangements. After there flight I received another email saying the refund was now HK$ 460, which is 3.7% of the ticket cost. Really bad customer service at Brisbane and Taoyuan airport and subsequently through emails.;Service for Hong Kong to Taipei was satisfactory while for Taipei to Brisbane, it was not good. There were no good choices for food. Later, due to flight cancellation, there were problems with the refund. The customer service at Brisbane and Taoyuan airport was substandard.
Jakarta to Vancouver via Taipei. First time flying on China Airlines after Expedia mistakenly cancelled our Air Canada booking. We were impressed with the aircraft which looked new and most up to date entertainment system. Our family enjoyed the food, even our children finished their meals and they're picky. What I was most impressed with was their customer service and ability to help us change flights in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic that occurred while we were away. Due to closing borders where we were scheduled to be on our way back home, we had to change our flight to a direct flight back home and we wanted to leave as early as possible. We could get never get through to Expedia at all (after hours on the phone) but China Airlines customer service was more than helpful and they were able make our changes for us and get us home even though we booked through Expedia. Next time I travel to Asia, I would consider China Airlines as a top choice carrier. ;In the trip from Jakarta to Vancouver, the China Airlines aircraft was new and impressive with latest entaertainment system, good food quality, and finest customer service. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the borders were closing and the China Airlines customer service helped us in changing flights and get back home. 
Myself my mother and my husband flew Gatwick to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines but will never fly with them again. The cabin crew on the first leg of the journey did not speak hardly at all. We could not hear nor understand the announcements so in an emergency it would have been guess work which I find astounding but in general I think its poor customer service. The food was just awful, I know it was 95% Chinese passengers but I think the airline should look at the list of people and cater for those who don't want to eat soggy rice and chicken on both the inbound and outbound flights. The blankets provided were a dirty mustard colour and were way past their use date. The cabin crew all were wearing face masks to protect themselves and passengers but found it totally unhygienic that they wiped down the toilet floors, units and toilet with paper towels and no gloves on, that to me was not only disgusting but a health and safety issue. Overall we all found our experience with China Airlines a very poor one. Never again to be repeated.;With China Airlines, the journey from Gatwick to Sydney via Taipei was a mess. There were no food choices other than Chinese food, the announcements were not understandable, customer service was poor and hygienic practice was below standard.
 They have no regard for consumer rights and will destroy your itinerary if they dont have enough passengers. Booked a flight for my wife, 3yr old and myself, directly with China Airlines via their webpage for a flight from Singapore to Takamatsu. This included a layover of 20hrs in Taipei which we also booked a nights stay at a hotel for. 1 month prior to departure they brought forward by a day, our TPE to TAK flight. As they did not change the Singapore to TPE flight the connection is now impossible. They rectified the problem by changing our SIN to TPE flight a day earlier but refused to make up for our lost hotel booking. We rebooked our hotel at our own cost. 11 days before departure, they changed our TPE to TAK flight again bringing it forward by 24hrs and again neglecting to make the appropriate amendment for SG to TPE. They have also again refused to compensate us in any way for having to book a hotel for the 3rd time. Warning! It looks cheap and respectable. It is a lie.;China Airlines did not show respect for customer rights in a trip from Singapore to Takamatsu. The changed flights two times before the departure date without making appropriate arrangements for the connecting flights. We had to book hotel three times at our own cost to match the flight timing.
The check-in in this case was a bit more complex, because my flight ability in Taipei had to be obtained through a stay in China. However, this can be assessed as positive for the health of other passengers. Departures and arrivals were on time. The A330 made a somewhat older impression and the seat pitch was below average. In the A350, on the B9other hand, cleanliness, comfort and seat spacing were good. The on-board entertainment left nothing to be desired and relatively new films were shown. Catering and drinks are very good and extensive. The staff friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience.;The check-in process was a bit compliacted but the flight was timely. A330 aircraft was old and the seat pitch was below the standard while the A350 was very clean, comfortable, and spacious. The entertainment, food, and service experiences were all fine.
Frankfurt to Shanghai via Taipei. Check-in was extremely quick and the staff very friendly. The departure was on time. The seat spacing is average in an international comparison. The on-board catering is very good and very extensive. The beverage service leaves nothing to be desired. Aircraft cleanliness contributed to well-being. Overall a good experience. The Inflight Entertainment offered relatively new and a lot of films.;An overall good experience with a quick check-in, friendly staff, on-time departure, good catering and entertainment, and an average seat spacing.
 Ho Chi Minh city to Frankfurt via Taipei, a good experience overall. I departed at 05:45 p.m., and meals were served 3 times, 1 dinner in the connecting flight from HCMC to Taipei and 2 on the flight from Taipei to Frankfurt. The food was good, but there were not many options and the menu was the same for both departing and returning flights. The crew were friendly and caring, they noticed when I felt uncomfortable due to low temperature inside the cabin and offered hot drinks. The seat was comfortable. I'm a rather small girl (162cm in height), so I had no problem with legroom, but it might have been a bit cramped for some other passengers around me. My returning date was a busy day for Frankfurt airport, so I had a delayed takeoff, which made me miss my connecting flight from Taipei to HCMC. I had a long delay at Taoyuan airport. The airlines handled the situation well, they offered me to stay in their lounge and took care of my baggage, coupons for food and bevarage were also given. The best part was I was upgraded to Premium economy on my flight back to HCMC. ;A positive experience in general for a trip from Ho Chi Minh city to Frankfurt via Taipei. The catering was fine but the food choices were limited. There was a delay in the takeoff but everyting was well handled by the airlines from the baggage and stay to food and drinks. Above all, the airline upgraded my flight to premium economy.
Great short-haul flight from Hong Kong to Tainan operated by Mandarin Airlines (owned by China Airlines). Departure and arrival on time. Plane modern, clean and comfy, considering short length of journey. Hot meal, snack and tea distributed during 1h flight - really appreciated. Staff very nice and active during entire flight.;A great experinece on a short flight from Hong Kong to Tainan in terms of comfort, cleanliness, food, and service.
Vancouver to Bangkok via Taipei. We took 4 flights in all. The service was friendly, meals were enjoyable, and there was plenty of video entertainment. Baggage was included in the ticket price. The accommodation was comfortable and we recommend this airline.;The flights from Vancouver to Bangkok via Taipei were pleasant and enjoyable. This is an airline to be recommended.
Taipei to Frankfurt. I am really upset about China Airline customer service and the abuse of regulations. I book my tickets via Expedia, and Expedia asks their users to input the names as: Family name, Middle Name, First Name. I input as it asks and they arrange my name as Western Order by Family name First Name Middle Name. This is a common way, even western government department does this to Asian name order. When I booked my ticket, Expedia forwarded my info to China Airline and I got charged 100€ for changing my name on the tickets. I booked through Expedia all the time with other Airlines and there has been no problem. With the pressure in the airport, I had to pay. Later I contact China Airline with this complaint and they act like this is my fault. That is really ignorant attitude from China Airlines. I explained to them in details, and they were pushing the problems to their regulation and Expedia. I am sure this is a systematic problem between Expedia and China Airlines, however the customer is the one that is blamed and paid the money. They reject my claim and complaint and complaint but doesn’t do better than abusing their regulations towards customers. As my first time flying, I feel mistrusted towards this airline.;I was imposed 100 euros due to change of name on the tickets that happened while booking tickets via Expedia. China Airlines insensible attitude towards the matter made me lose the trust and confidence in flying through this airline.
Bangkok to Taipei. I fail to understand why this flight and the return leg arrived at and departed from Terminal 2. The ticket specifies Terminal 1, Immigration and baggage delivery are at Terminal 1 and the return check-in is at Terminal 1. This is not the first time this has happened on a CI flight. So why does CI not have proper facilities in Terminal 2 or mark the ticket information as Terminal 2? As far as I am aware, on arrival at TPE there was no announcement on the aircraft and no printed announcement on the video monitors. Passengers were therefore left with a weakly written and seemingly unimportant sign on exiting the Gate ramp. But a China Airlines attendant stood right in front and in the middle of that sign rendering it impossible to read. And her main job seemed to be to direct passengers en route to a soon departing Fukuoka flight since the Bangkok flight had arrived late. The only sign exiting passengers can easily see is the bright illuminated sign above stating that for Immigration passengers should turn right. That, though, is for Terminal 2 Immigration and baggage claim. The handwritten sign that should be in very large thick clear lettering easily visible to all disembarking passengers pointed out that those going to Terminal 1 should actually turn left and then walk a very long way. A staff member giving instructions in Chinese is of little use to those not conversant in the language! Having been caught out by this once before and wasted almost an hour, after this flight I stopped and took time to check the sign carefully. This unthought-through action apart, the flight was smooth and the meal very tasty. My only other gripe about China Airlines is the headphones for the IFE. It makes available the ancient circular ones. I accept these fit nicely into the ears of a majority of passengers. But not all ears are the same and they just don’t fit mine at all. So even though this, with a weather delay, was only a 4-hour flight, watching anything on the IFE was out of the question.;In a Bangkok to Taipei flight, the ticket mentioned Terminal 1 but actually the arrival and departure was at terminal 2. passengers were not guided properly. In general the flight was comfy and the meal was delicious. The headphones provided were not a good fit.
✅ Trip Verified |  This is first time I use China Airlines, also this is the last time. I never use again and will recommend other people don’t use this China Airlines.  This aircraft is small and old. The F&B is not good, very bad. The staff is not helpful. They don’t support the passengers. I needed to change the middle seat to aisle seat, but they ask me for charging money.  I didn’t request change to another higher class seat, just same economy. When I get aboard, I saw 4 empty seat around me. ;The experience was regretable. The plane was old, meals were not good amd, the staff was unhelpful. They charged money for changing the seat even in the same economy class.
✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei. Check-in at LAX was smooth. They gave us a transfer sleeve to store boarding passes for later segment, which was a nice touch. We had a remote gate far away and had to be shuttled by bus. That experience wasn't very pleasant as we had to wait inside the bus for a very long time. Despite having reservation for four seats (traveling as a family), there was no available overhead storage. All four of us had requested special meals, but the flight attendants started serving us regular meal. It was only after we showed them our boarding passes that they served our special meals. The overall ambiance, seating comfort, and IFE were excellent. Both B777-300ER and A330-300 were tastefully decorated. The service between Taipei and Bali segment was far superior to what we experience between LA and Taipei. The service on our final segment from TPE to LAX fell below the mark. The flight attendants serving us in economy didn't smile and were quite rude while interacting with us. So, while friendly service was absent in TPE-LAX segment, the WiFi worked well on B777-300ER. Overall, China Airlines offered an inconsistent experience where the positives outweighed the negatives, so we will still fly with them again.;In a journey from Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei, the experience was varying, sometimes good and sometimes not so good. Check-in was smooth, flight environment, comfort, and entertainment were superior. The return segment experience was not pleasing.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Sanya. Our plane was late getting into Taipei from Los Angeles and we had just enough time to disembark and walk to the gate of our connecting flight to be the last persons to board. I told my wife that I was sure our luggage wasn’t going to make the connection. I sat down at my window seat and watched the last of the luggage being loaded but did not see ours. The cabin door closed and I expected us to leave but we didn’t. I could see the baggage handlers impatiently waiting for something. Alas, 10 minutes later a buggy showed up with our luggage and was quickly loaded and we were then on our way. Our flight ended up late and although I felt a little guilty we really appreciated our luggage arriving with us. The food we just ok. The staff were friendly but busy.;The trip from Taipei to Sanya was occupied with late landing into Taipei making it difficult to get the connecting flight. The luggage arrived finally, the meals were good and the customer service was fine.
✅ Trip Verified | Taipei to Vienna. I find the service in Business Class worth the money. The friendliness and readiness to serve you is very good. The seat is one of the most comfortable seats in business class. The food, especially the breakfast, is very good and tasty, champagne and wine was excellent as well. IFE offers you a large screen and is very responsive. The variety to choose from was also more than enough. ;Travelling from Taipei to Vienna in business class was a great experience. The seat comfort, food, and entertainment were excellent.
"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Taipei. This is the worst flight I've ever been on in my life.  I got a discount on this flight, and the stewardesses were nice. Everything else about was a nightmare. I called a week in advance and had to pay for the desired seat I wanted for $30 extra because this airline doesn't let you choose your seat. But they ended up giving me the wrong seat anyway, rather than 40E, which is larger. They could not fix the issue on the plane, so I was stuck with the tiny seat and wasted my $30. Some seats can lift the armrest, but the one I had to go to could not and was quite uncomfortable. I then learned that this was the first flight I've been on that doesn't offer free WiFi. I had to pay $50 (specifically $43.90) to use their very bad WiFi service. The ""entertainment"" tablet doesn't work, even if you rub it or clean it, and there's nothing on there you've ever heard of, anyway. The food looked inedible, but that's okay because I opted not to eat anyway. It just sucks you have to pay for water, since TSA obviously doesn't let you bring any liquids on. Guess I should've brought a bigger water bottle.  Sixteen hours of this, and they don't even offer you WiFi or working power outlets (though I'm surprised we even had those). This airline just seems cheap, even if their actual prices aren't that cheap. ";The flight from New York to Taipei was the worst. Only that the flight offered a discount price and the hostess were positives. The rest of the experiences were bad.
✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to Taipei. Priority check-in at Narita was quick and easy. I was able to change my seat at the counter. Boeing 777 has a beautifully designed cabin and offers lots of choices on the inflight entertainment system. The cabin manager on this flight was  kind and helpful. I was welcomed on board and addressed by name. The vegetarian special meal was of a good quality. There was a selection of drinks available, I tried Kumquat Lemonade and Formosa green tea. On arrival, my luggage was first off the belt as it was marked Priority. I am a SkyTeam Elite Plus member and I never experienced such attention to detail and personal service.;From Tokyo to Taipei, the check-in was smooth, and the plane was beautiful, and lots of choices for in-flight entertainment. The staff was welcoming and, the meals and beverages were great. The personal service offered was very good.
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew to Brisbane from Auckland and return. A350  was roomy and comfortable in Economy Class. Crew were friendly. IFE with a good selection of movies, TV and music. Crew on return flight indifferent and sour. Meals were awful - spiced chicken and rice - worse than a microwavable meal from the supermarket. In summary crew need to lift their game. English is often poor and engagement nowhere near Singapore Airlines.;The flight from Auckland to Brisbane was roomy and comfy, with a friendly cabin crew and a good in-flight entertainment. While the return flight was totally unpleasent with bland meals.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Honolulu via Taipei. I fly regularly between Honolulu and Bangkok, but I've never flown on China Airlines. However, it emerged as the least-expensive option for a recent trip and since the price and flight schedules were good I decided to give the airline a try, despite some hesitation. I was mostly pleasantly surprised by the airline: Though the staff seem to be unable to smile and service both on the ground and in the air is bare-bones, the A350 is a fabulous aircraft, the seats were mostly comfortable, and the entertainment system was alright. There were a few negative experiences: For instance, not one single flight arrived or departed on time; The airline's pillows and blankets are pitiful, and the catering is mostly inedible; China Airlines has the serving style favored by many Asian airlines, wherein a few drinks choices are offered on top of the meal service trolleys, and if a passenger requests anything not on top of the trolley, the flight attendants tend to lie and say they ran out. It's very, very tedious to constantly have to ask and remind them for something as simple as a can of Coke Zero, and for it to be brought with a scowl. I arrived at Taipei from Honolulu in the middle Typhoon Mitag; My onward flight to Bangkok that evening was cancelled and I was expecting a chaotic, uncomfortable evening in Taipei's airport. Much to my surprise, the situation had been rather expertly arranged before my arrival: An agent met our flight and informed all of us going to Bangkok that we had been rescheduled for a flight the following morning and that accommodation had been arranged for us for that evening. I was impressed by the efficiency of China Airlines and the Taipei airport authorities, and I commend them for their handling of a difficult situation. In all, I recommend China Airlines because of the very low cost paid for this set of flights. While China Airlines certainly pales in comparison to ANA, JAL, EVA Air, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines, it is at least as good as Korean Air.";From Bangkok to Honolulu via Taipei, the price was reasonable but the aircraft was fabulous with spacious seats and good entertainment. There were negatives including the delays in flight arrival and departure, the blankets and pillows were pathetic, food choices were limited. But to a pleasent surprise, for the cancelled connecting flight, the flight was rescheduled and the accomodation was arranged.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. The onboard experience was fine. The problem with this airline is the ground customer service and code-share system. I have no idea why, but China Airlines would not allow me to select my seats in advance or even change my seats at check-in. It seems that some tickets simply do not have an online check-in or seat selection option. You are forced to get to the check-in desk when it opens (about 3hrs before a flight) and try to get them to change the seat they assign to you. This creates a mad rush at check-in, and a strong likely-hood of not sitting with your companion and getting the middle seat. This is exactly what happened to me in Taipei. I flew in on a code-share flight with Vietnam Airlines. There was no online check-in option for the China Airlines portion of the flight. At check-in in Saigon, China Airlines automatically assigned my wife and me to two middle seats in different rows (not together). I asked the Vietnam Airlines agent if we could change the seat assignments, but they were unable to access seating for China Airlines. When I got to Taipei for the connection, I went to the China Airlines office to change the seats, and they said all seats were assigned and the flight was full, but that the boarding counter could probably do something. I went to the boarding gate, and they said they would make a note of this. I asked what that meant, and they said they would tell the stewardess. I asked what that meant, and they said the stewardess would look for spare seats. I asked why they couldn't see if there were any spare seats, and the boarding gate said they could, and there were none, 'but maybe someone would be too sick to fly'. There was no attempt to look for people that were willing to move from one seat to another to accommodate my wife and I sitting together. No effort what so ever, they just wanted to tell me they took my name. The boarding agents said it was a common problem that people could not check-in online or select their seats in advance. The boarding agents even laughed as I walked away. The problem is not just the boarding agents, its China Airlines inability to allow online check-in or seat selection on booking flights. I'm not sure why they don't have a system that would do this? Regardless, I will not fly with this airline again.;For China Airlines, flying from Taipei to Vancouver, the onboard experience was positive while the ground customer service was problematic and uncooperative in adjusting our seats. I will not fly with China Airlines in future.
✅ Trip Verified |  Vienna to Auckland via Taipei and Brisbane. I am very happy with the experience . I flew in Economy Class, at the height of 1,83m / 6ft I had enough legroom. Vienna to Taipei I was offered to change my original seat to a seat in a row which was completely free (I did manage to sleep a couple of hours on this flight as I could kind of lie down during the flight.) The remaining two flights were fully booked and if 3 men sit next to each other, there is not too much space in Economy class but it did not feel uncomfortable. The cabin crew was very friendly and the service was very good. I enjoyed the meals and the in-flight entertainment. The A350-900 is a great and modern airplane I can definitely recommend.;the flight offered a pleasant experience with the economy class having enough legroom, a friendly staff, good service, enjoyable meals and entertainment. This is an airline to be recommended.
"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Jakarta via Taipei. Will never fly with China airlines again, flight attendants are rude no common courtesy, get into your personal space without warning no ""excuse me"" no nothing! Felt like a harrasment because I purchased a premium economy seats for my infant and have to argue back and forth about it because they didn't believe my 1,5 year old is not 2 years old, I bought 3 premium economy seats for my 2 kids and I but they only gave me 2 meals and not counting my other kid! Their excuse is they don't have infant food even tho I told them my 1,5 year old can eat anything, asking me to show my kid passport all the time because they thought my 1,5 year old is too big for her age. Told me to deflate my flytot even tho other passengers in economy class are allowed to using theirs, even after I deflated it they keep coming back and woken me up because they thought I was still using it! I have to literally show them I didn't use the flytot anymore!  Again I will never fly with China airlines ever again. The only reason I gave 2 stars for cabin service and not 1 star is because one of the flight attendant actually felt bad for keep asking me about my child. But out of 4 flights we've taken only 1 was bearable.";While travelling from Los Angeles to Jakarta, we had a terrible experience with the China airlines. The flight attendents were not courteous and behaved rudely. I will not reiterate my trip with China Airlines in future.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Beijing return. The inbound flight was delayed over one hour. The customer service in Beijing offered passengers snacks and soft drinks. Overall, the service was very nice. Seats are comfortable. I enjoyed both flights.;On returning from Taipei to Bejing, the flight was delayed but the seating was comfortable and the service was good.
✅ Trip Verified | We flew Brisbane to London Gatwick via Taipei and return with China Airlines. We weren’t delayed on any of the flights there or back. Blankets, pillows were waiting for us when we boarded. On the longer legs (Taipei - Gatwick & Gatwick - Taipei) amenity kits were provided (we were in economy!) so that was a nice little extra. The seats were not comfortable at all which is a shame and the food was a little disappointing. The cabin service was alright. Would recommend for the price. They were the cheapest tickets at the time of booking.;The flights offered a fair price and were on time, service was good, amenity kits were supplied even in the economy class. Seat comfort and food were unreasonable.
✅ Trip Verified |  China Airlines has the worst customer service and support. We booked a round trip from Singapore to Vancouver last week. Our flight got cancelled due to a typhoon in Taipei and we got to know of it just a day before we were suppose to fly. There was no way to reach out to the airlines - no helpline 24*7. It was a struggle to contact the airline and we wrote on their Facebook page on which they responded. They asked to wait and asked to visit the airport next day morning. Got there early morning and they blatantly said they can’t do anything! Flight is cancelled and no replacement to fly. We were told there is one flight which was on very short notice and we coudnt have possibly taken it! With no way out we booked another flight to do our trip paying a lot more extra. We reached Vancouver and were continuously getting messages from China Airlines for our return flight which made us comfortable that our outgoing flight is on! To our horror, we were stopped from boarding the flight! And then came in the China Airlines supervisor who broke some news to us which none bothered to convey till then by the airlines. First he said if you board the flight you can’t get refund for the incoming flight which we technically did use. Yes, we couldn't use because you cancelled the flight and did not give any backup flight to the helpless customer. None of the customer service people at the airport told us about the refund and cancellation in such scenarios. Zero communication. The supervisor blatantly asked to decide whether to board and forget the refund for one way or buy another ticket and take a full refund. We were aghast. This isn’t just a monetary situation but a big mental pressure for someone travelling with family. The airline showed no sympathy towards the child too. To convey the same we went to one of the representatives and they kinda looked lost had no idea and then directed us to someone else, laughing at out back. This is ridiculous and shows the airline lacks basic human courtesy! A little later the supervisor came and said That we can't board the flight altogether! Since the ticket stands null and void! None from the airlines conveyed us till now and instead we were getting all flight updates on messages. Is it a technical problem that your system shows customer wrong information and you the right information? We coudnt sleep looking for another pocket friendly Flight to go Home and hotel to stay. Who’s to be blamed? We may forget the financial loss but the mental agony China Airlines has caused is beyond words.;Our flight from Singapore to Vancouver got cancelled due a storm. Customer service and support were awful. We paid more and booked another flight to continue with our trip. we got messages from Chine airline for the operating return flight but shockingly we were informed that a new ticket was needed to board the return flight and only then the refund could be possible. The airline caused financial pressure as well as mental suffering.
✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Brisbane via Taipei. Extremely good experience! Firstly terrific value for money as this similar trip with Turkish Airlines or Singapore Airlines was going to cost over double the price of China Airlines! Ground staff were helpful and efficient, lounge in Taipei was great and cabin crew service was friendly yet not overbearing. The food on all sectors was terrific with plenty of variety in the meals across all 4 sectors - I always chose to eat rather than sleep since I didn't want to miss the meal! Seats are very comfortable and happily got all the sleep I could. Both the B777 and A350 were enjoyable although the A350 is the newer and better product. I was worried about my bags as I also had a flight before Frankfurt but both bags happily made it through all 6 flights without being lost or damaged. Only negatives are that the entertainment system is a bit limited with about 50% of the movies in English with few of them particularly recent and the selection is poorly organised, especially compared to someone like Emirates, but in Business Class it was easy to sleep rather than watch a movie - this would be a bigger problem in Economy where it's harder to get good sleep. Also their flight schedule can lead to some long transit layovers in Taipei and they make too many announcements in the lounge, which was especially unnecessary when a small delay of 20 minutes on my flight was communicated to me via text, email and a lounge attendant even came and found me personally to let me know! So many announcements affected the atmosphere a bit and made it hard to rest. Definitely recommended with a terrific value for money in Business Class and a great product and service.;Flying in Business class with China airlines from Frankfurt to Bribane was an awesome experience especilly considering the price. Food quality, service, seats were all fine. In-flight entertainment was somewhat limited. Overall, a best and worth value for money experience for the business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  I booked round-trip flight from LAX to Bangkok via Taipei for January 2020. Since the time I booked the flight 5 months ago, the flight times were changed at least 5 times. The latest arrival time is much later than the original arrival time which created a problem for my plans. I cancelled the fight but was charged $200 cancellation fee ($100 for each person in the booking). Since my cancellation was due to China Airline’s change of schedule, the $200 cancellation fee should be waived. But China Airline refused to refund. ;For a jouney from Los Angeles to Bangkok, the flight timing was changed five times in about five months. Finally, I had to cancel the flight and the cancellation fee was not waived.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Denpasar to Rome via Taipei. The first leg on our return journey (DPS-TPE) was by an old 747- 400: the aircraft was pretty rundown, with a bad smell and very narrow seats; the old IFE didn't work properly and FA tried to reboot the system multiple times but my personal screen didn't work properly. Food average. The second leg (TPE-FCO) was a different story: the A350 is a great plane : plenty of space, great IFE and I could stretch my legs and sleep almost the whole flight, wonderful mood lights and smiling FA made this 13 hours journey very pleasant.";For Denpasar to Rome via Taipei, both legs have different experience stories. For the first one, the aircraft was old and uncomfortable while the food was mediocre. For the second leg, the journey was wonderful.
✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Bangkok via Taipei return. All 4 flights  were nothing short of exemplary, operated by an A350, which is much quieter and noticeably reduces jet lag. The crew on all my flights were friendly, professional and very safety conscious. Meal service was prompt and with a smile, and the crew were polite and friendly. I ordered several drinks and requested a toothbrush and an adapter and all were delivered quickly. They passed out hot towels for economy class passengers which is a much-appreciated gesture. During the overnight flight staff often passed through the cabin with water and juice, and kept the toilets clean. My flight back to Melbourne was delayed by 8 hours and we were provided accommodation at the Novotel near Taipei airport and they organised a shuttle bus to take us back to the airport in the morning, I found the ground staff at Taipei airport to be friendly and customer focused. The onboard entertainment system is easy to navigate and had many new releases and TV shows to choose from. The only aspect that could be improved is their food options, I found most of my meals to be lacking flavor, however they did offer an ice cream bar and a bread roll with all meals. Staff offer a selection of juice soft drinks, wine and coffee/Chinese tea with the meal service. I would not hesitate to fly with them again, in fact I found their service to be superior to Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines and would recommend China Airlines without hesitation.;My experience of flying with China airlines from Malbourne to Bangkok came upon a point that service quality of China airlines is better relative to Cathay Pacific and Malaysia airlines. Aircraft was good, food and beverage service was swift. Due to flight delay, airlines provided accomodation at Novotel. I recommend China airlines.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. Relatively new A350 with comfortable seats and nice 11"" IFE screen with USB and power outlet. The back seat design lacks enough forethought in not making available slots for tablets and mobile phones and a hook for small items to hang. Having said that there is good legroom space. The entertainment choice is still limited. The flight crew service was better than the ICN-TPE leg but they lack the courteousness that other Asian airlines are known for. One example, one flight attendant told a passenger to bring the seat back upright for a meal. She was quite rude and abrupt. For a Chinese her manner would have been viewed as a typical request, but as a flight attendant serving passengers of various nationalities, that would not be acceptable. She looked as if she was one of the more senior member of the flight crew. The food was still below average and the flight attendants were once again rushing through the meal service offering coffee and tea even though passengers had not finished the main meal. Overall, they lack the expected attention to detail and professionalism to compete effectively with other airlines. The excellent hardware, ie. the plane, is let down by the subpar flight crew service.";The fabolous aircraft experience was let down by inferior service quality of the cabin crew. The entertainment options were limited and the food was substandard. The crew lacked the courtesy for which Asian airlines are well-known.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seoul Incheon to Taipei. The flight crew lacks the polish and professionalism of some airlines. The meal service was rushed with coffee and tea being offered even before most could finish the meal and in a rushed manner that if you were not paying attention you would have missed them. The IFE is an old outdated 6.5"" touch screen that is due for an update with relatively limited choice of entertainment. The pillows and blankets were not separately packaged raising questions of possible sanitation. The food quality is below average. One thing that is going for China Airlines is their fare which tends to be cheaper than others.";For China airlines, the flight fares are cheap but the cabin crew do not behave professionally.
✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Vancouver via Taipei. My overall experience is okay. Needs further improvement on the audio. Also, the food should be improved, aesthetically and by flavor. Our taste buds aren’t much functional when in high altitude, so it is a must that aroma and flavor of the food compliments each other, or else, all of the food will just taste all pretty much the same. I had a bad experience in my baggage when the ground steward in Manila told me that my baggage will go straight to Saskatoon (my final destination), and not to be picked up in Vancouver. Since I was a new flyer, I didn’t know much of this. I even clarified (twice) with the steward if I will be picking it up in Saskatoon or Vancouver, and he kept on saying that it’s gonna be in Saskatoon. But when I arrived in Saskatoon, my baggage wasn’t there. So much inconvenience on my part. They need to have well-trained and knowledgeable staff when it comes to these types of situation, or a mentor should be around in this case. With this, I don’t know if I will fly with China Airlines anymore.;Flying from Manila to Vancouver, the experience was mediocre. Food needs improvement and the staff should be knowledgeable enough. I had a bad experience with my luggage due to wrong information from the staff.
Not Verified |  Taipei to San Francisco. Overall experience is fine. The worst part is at the check-in counter they always ask you to show the credit card used for purchasing the ticket. When I purchased tickets for my kids and they travel alone, they almost got stranded at the airport and couldn’t get on the flight;the flight experience was good. The difficult part is the check-in, they require you to show the credit card. Incase, the children are traveling alone, it becomes a problem.
✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Hanoi via Taipei. Amazing cabin crew. They are professional, caring and nice. Updated in-flight entertainment programme. Food is fairly good. They serve ice-cream for lunch.;In the Frankfurt to Hanoi flight, the crew was the best, flight entertainment was up-to-date, and the meals were fair.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Osaka via Taipei, returning from Sapporo. Overall China Airlines offers a decent Business Class at a reasonable fare. Both check-in processes were efficient and friendly. The lounges in Melbourne, Taipei and Sapporo were comfortable without being luxurious - good spaces to relax, with pleasant food and drink options. On board, the seats turned into nice lie-flat beds, the main downside being a lack of storage space around the seats. The crews were hardworking, polite and generally friendly. Only soft drinks were offered as a welcome, but there was a reasonable wine and spirits list. My vegetarian meals were fine but not adventurous. No amenities kits were provided, and there were no toothbrushes/paste provided in the toilets -- a sign of some cutting of corners in this product. Three flights operated punctually, one was delayed 30 minutes due to ""ground handling issues"". Taipei is quite an easy transfer point, with good signage and friendly staff.";China airlines gave us a cool business class experience at a good price. The check-in was swift, lounges were comfy, nice food and drink choices. On-board facilities were fine instead no amenity kits were provided. The staff was also friendly.
✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Taipei. Originally I was booked on EVA Air, but about a week before my flight in late June 2019 they went on strike with a number of flights cancelled and I was changed to this flight about a week before my departure. EVA operates an A330 with 2-2-2 in business class on this route but China Airlines operates an A350-900 with a 1-2-1 and what a stunning cabin this is probably the nicest business class cabin I have travelled. With a late departure around 2250 from Brisbane and an arrival into Taipei at 0545 the next morning with just under 9 hours in the air the quick meal service on departure was well organized and excellent quality which left a reasonable amount of time for some sleep before breakfast before arrival in Taipei. The seat on this plane is fantastic with plenty of storage a great screen and a very sturdy table that pulls out from under the screen and always have a little part exposed so is always a handy shelf at anytime. The finishes that they have used seem to be of a really high quality with my 16 month old plane looking like it was on its first flight. No pyjamas are provided but slippers and a nice amenity kit are. ;From Brisbane to Taipei, I had a wonderful business class experience with the China Airlines. The departure was a bit delayed but the seating and service was fantastic.
✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. The walking aisle was no bigger than for 1 person (like planes in short flights), therefore it was not possible to stretch your legs, and in the flight London - Sydney you really need it. I would not recommend this company for more than 4 hr flight max. The food was very boring, pretty much all the same - rice with something. I was woken up by staff in the middle of the flight and ask to move to my original seat even I was already there, I showed my ticked, however the staff didn't apologise me. Very upsetting when it is very hard to fall in sleep in the very uncomfortable flight, but instead of enjoying it you been woken up. ;I do not recommend this airline for a flight longer than 4 hours. Food was quite boring and the staff attitude was non-courteous.
✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Taipei. Service excellent and staff were professional. Food was far better than expected. The plane was very comfortable and quiet. After 8 hours plus of travel arrived to Taipei Flights seem to go quick.;The flight from Dehli to Taipei was pleasant and cozy with professioanl service and good food.
✅ Trip Verified |  Service excellent, all staff were professional. Food was far better than expected. The A350 was very comfortable and quiet. After 24 hours plus of travel arrived into Gatwick with no aches and pains. Flights seem to go quick. Leg room excellent. Only thing missing was the camera. Previously flown China Airlines from Syd to Akl and on the A330 they had the nose camera and the kids loved seeing take off and landing. The A350 does not have this. The camera is a very minor point as the IFE made up for this. System very quick and did not cause any issues. Good selection of movies and TV shows. Fare unbeatable.;The airlines offered a fabulous service at an amazing fare. The food quality, leg room, in-flight entertainment were all fine. Only the nose camera was missing.
"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Manila via Taipei. Unbelievably horrible! Flight for my brother was May 1st. It's now the 7th and my brother still doesn't have his luggage! He can't buy clothes his size in the Philippines. I spent 7 hours and $200 in international calls trying to track down his lost luggage. His luggage ""may"" show up in Manila tomorrow - seriously? Worst customer service.";The flight experience from Los Angeles to Manila was terrible and the customer service was severely bad.
✅ Trip Verified |  Overall an excellent Business Class product on the A350, the seat offers privacy and comfort with an easy to operate inflight entertainment system. The negatives I found were that the blanket provided was too thin and the seven hour wait for the connecting flight on the return journey out of Taipei too long. The cabin service was good, particularly Taipei to London where the service was faultless. I will definitely look to use the airline again in the future.;A marvelous business class experience. The only negative was that the blanket was too thin. I will fly with this airline in future.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Honolulu. A wonderful experience. The seat the best, cabin staff warm and efficient, the entertainment good enough. Food presentation is wonderful, an appealing service. The food itself needs refining, lightening in terms of sauces etc but that is minor. I highly recommend the business class.;The best business class experience from Taipei to Honululu. The comfortable seats, cordial staff, good entertainment, and food, all add to the positive experience.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Taipei. I had an extremely bad experience with China Airlines, and request some answers from them. We bought tickets mid February for return tickets : Hong Kong – Taiwan (flight CI 922). At check-in, the morning of the flight, the staff simply told us that we couldn’t take our flight. Besides generating a huge frustration feeling before our holidays even start, the fact that she didn’t propose any solution or even look for solution is simply astonishing. So the reason she gave us is that our names on the booking didn’t match our passports. To be precise, our First Name was correct, and our Family Name was also correct. BUT, she told me that we had to put all our middle names as well with our First Names. Apparently, this is a change in the policy that was pushed before, but she was not able to tell us how recently. And as we did not put our middle names, our tickets were unusable, we couldn’t take the plane. Everything else was correct : passport number, dates, etc. No solution proposed, no real help, nothing… Oh wait, actually yes, she proposed us a solution : buy new tickets, obviously ! In my country, the middle names are absolutely never used. Moreover, every time I didn’t put our middle names in the booking, all the companies let us go on the plane. But China Airlines only decided not to. So I tried to find a solution, any action we could do to amend it. Of course, modifying the booking online by myself was prohibited by China Airlines website. I went back on the website to check the display of the booking page, and where this rule is written. So actually there is now a mention in brackets to put middle names (which I don’t remember to see last time, anyway). However, there are only 2 boxes called “Last Name” and “First Name”. If you require middle names too, add a dedicated box, it is clearer. On top of that, my first name contains an hyphen, but the website does not accept it. Moreover, I have commas between my middle names, but as the website does not accept special characters neither, how to input them ? Finally, where there is a change in policy, you should make it more obvious ! The technical limitations of the website make everything even more confusing. So at the counter I asked her to amend our booking; not possible neither. How come ?? Wait, actually, yes, she could modify the booking, but ONLY 3 LETTERS… What ? yes, 3 letters. So she managed to amend our son’s booking as the middle name was only 3 letters long (of course, with a fee), but not ours… What of a rule is this ? So actually, China Airlines CAN amend booking. Technically and regulatory, it is possible(I presume China airlines will use some kind of dark regulation to explain that only 3 letters can be changed for security purposes…) They just didn’t for us. So we finally bought new tickets, with fees, more expensive of course. I made reimbursement request for the old ones, and of course, no answer yet. And I don’t expect any. Better have customers paying twice and not losing money, right China airlines ? At Taipei counter, I told China Airlines staff my story, and ask them if they could amend our names, they replied “yes it should be possible to amend”, “hum, I don’t understand why they told you that in Hong Kong, I am not sure why”.";A dreadful experience with China airlines for a flight from Hong Kong to Taipei. There was problem with our name order on the tickets and the staff didn't help us ammend, neither did they reimburse. We had to buy new expensive tickets again.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. Very comfortable product. Seat and food excellent, especially for a long total journey after transit in TPE. Service attentive but not over the top. Drinks a little limited but pleasant enough. Inflight WiFi fast and TPE lounge generally comfortable too although did start to get a bit crowded.;We had a comfortable experience with China airlines from Taipei to Vancouver.
✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Honolulu via Taipei. This is the worst airline ever. They have cancelled our flight from April 5th to April 3rd and our return trip from April 19th to April 21st, which caused us a lot of trouble to change our itinerary and we had to cancel our business deal with our customers. Their are 4 of us and they split our seating and 4 of us have to sit separate of each other.;A very bad experience for a flight from Bangkok to Honolulu. The flight was cancelled and we had to abondon our business deal.
✅ Trip Verified |  Awful customer service! I purchased a 2-segments tickets through China Airline website. The 2nd segment (New York to Boston) was carried by JetBlue. When I contacted China Airlines to get refund for the 2nd segment, they told me that JetBlue did something to the ticket so they can't process the ticket in their system right now. I asked China Airlines to talk directly to JetBlue, but they wouldn't do it. They kept asking me to translate their issues for them although I don't even know some of the terminology used. And each time when I called back to China Airlines, I got connected to a different rep so I had to repeat my story and tell the 2nd rep about what the first rep told me and what JetBlue told me. These went on for 4 rounds. Each round, I had to explain more, why there need to be a refund, what the 1st rep said, what JetBlue replied, what the 2nd rep said, etc. It is an unbelievably bad customer service. Finally, somehow they were able to process it and told me they'd contact me about the refund. Few days later, I got an email from China airline telling me that yes, they could refund me now, but I'll need to personally go to a China Airlines office, which is in a completely different state, far from the state I live to get this refund! I was very furious and replied by asking who would pay the airfare for me to fly to another state to get this refund in person and why couldn't they simply refund the money back to the credit card I used to purchased the tickets in the first place. At this moment, I have not gotten any reply about my email and have not seen the money deposited to my credit card either.;I have experienced the worst ever customer service from China Airlines. For the two segment ticket, I wanted refund for the second segment, China airlines said they could not process the ticket. After multiple phone calls, the problem was resolved. Later, china airlines contacted me to get the refund personally from their office which was in a different state and I had to fly to get it.
"✅ Trip Verified |  
Amsterdam to Seoul via Taipei. The flight in the A350 from Amsterdam to Taipei was very comfortable. Especially the food and inflight entertainment made a good impression. Wifi was available, however quite expensive. The second flight from TPE to ICN was in the Boeing 747-400. This plane felt quite old and the seats and inflight entertainment were obviously old.";For a flight from Amsterdam to Seoul through Taipei, the first leg was very comfortable while in the second flight, the plane felt outdated.
✅ Trip Verified |  Kaohsiung to Hong Kong. I checked in at the Kaohsiung airport today at the business class counter. Was greeted by two extremely rude desk staff! Completely surprised. In the past I have always had good experience it it seems service quality is going down. Strongly encourage others to avoid this airline till they get their act together. The flight itself was fine.;The flight experience was fine but the customer service seemed rude and discourteous.
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Bangkok via Taipei. The seats on their 777-300 and A350 are excellent, wide and full lie-flat, and decent blanket. The seats are sturdy, so you can't feel movement by other passengers in neighboring seats getting up and down. Amenities are decent, and the cabin staff is attentive. Overall, though, this is at best a middling business-class product. Unlike other airlines, you don't get Champagne before departure, just a choice of apple juice, orange juice, or water. In-flight entertainment options are quite limited, with many movies and TV shows available only in Chinese. The food tends to be merely edible, and seldom appetizing or enjoyable. It's beyond me why they charge business class passengers for WiFi - there's nothing like paying upwards of $5000 for a single ticket, trying to log on to WiFi, and finding that you need to pay extra for WiFi access. As for ground service, China Airlines lounges are notoriously bleak. They're often quite crowded, and the food and beverage choices are ridiculously limited. (In Taipei, for example, they have 4-5 dim sum varieties on offer, some congee, and a couple of other Chinese offerings, such as a cabbage stir-fry dish. At the SFO lounge, the choices are vastly more limited. You'll get far better food outside in the terminal.) The functionality of the China Airlines website is primitive at best - I have yet to find out how to pull up my itinerary without trying to check in.;The seats and aircraft was quite comfortable and pleasant. While food choices were limited, inflight entertainment has more content in Chineses and the lounges were crowded with limited food and drink offerings.
✅ Trip Verified | Flight attendants on the NGO-TPE leg (A333) and TPE-NGO (B738) surely made this flight a memorable one. They were so attentive and despite being Taiwanese, their Japanese language skills were superb. TPE-KUL-TPE was just heaven. The decor on the B777-300ER was well thought out. The flight attendant on the KUL-TPE leg went beyond the norm of a normal FA. When I asked the brand of the Oolong tea served on the aircraft, she gladly gave me a tea bag of the one they serve on flight. My wife and I did an overnight at Taipei but I would definetely recommend and fly China Airlines again on my next trip to Southeast Asia.;The flight attendants were the best part. Although they were Taiwanese, but they were fluent in Japanese also. They served us gladly. I would recommend China airlines.
✅ Trip Verified |  Vienna to Palau via Taipei. It was an excellent experience. The service was consistent and cordial on all 4 legs of the trip. I find the business class seat very comfortable on the A350. The old school seat on the 737 is comfortable enough for the shorter flights. On my way back flying Palau to Taipeh I was the only passenger in C and the flight attendant did everything to keep my glass filled.  Food was good and plenty, the entertainment was good with many choices. I tested the onboard WLan which was alright, but not really needed. The lounge in Taipeh was comfortable and the shower highly appreciated. On my final leg to Vienna a (minor) medical incident occured and they looked for medical personnel. Me and another MD attended the passenger. Afterwards the purser came personally to thank me and bowed to me. I felt very special being a customer of this airline!;A fantastic business class experience with China airlines. The warm and friendly service, good meals and entertainment, comfortable lounges were all appreciable.
✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Manila via Taipei.  All 4 segments of our flights went relatively well, there were no hassles and the fare we paid was good especially since this was for Christmas peak season. The San Francisco-Taipei and Taipei-San Francisco flights both were excellent but the Taipei-Manila and Manila-Taipei were okay. SFO-TPE: Check-in was a breeze and there were no hassles with the luggage although we were slightly overweight by a fraction. The B777-300ER plane we flew looks fairly new. We got seats 71H & 71K - perfect for couples. Food was good, service was decent. There were lots of entertainment options, movies, etc. and monitor was huge and resolution was sharp. Toilet was clean and I was told flight crew periodically clean it/wipe it down, which was well appreciated. They exceeded my expectations. TPE-MNL: We had 1.5 hours of transit time but lines were very long through security. Aircraft was A330 with a 2-4-2 configuration. We loved the fact that we were seated on a pair of seats as we like to keep to ourselves. Service was decent, nothing exceptional. Food was okay. There were some entertainment options on board including movies but since this was a 2-hour flight, it was not enough to finish a complete movie. The aircraft was also older and the monitor was smaller and not as sharp than the B777-300ER. MNL-TPE: Same aircraft as TPE-MNL with similar experience. My only unfavorable comment was that restrooms weren't clean on this flight. Some passenger completely made a mess in the entire lavatory and it appears flight crew do not clean this, possibly because it was a very short flight. TPE-SFO: Similar comments as CI003 SFO-TPE. We were seated on 70H & 70K. We really loved the pair of seats in the back. Again, food and service were excellent. No transit issues as we purposely took the 11-hour layover to see the city. However, immigration line took 1.5 hours - not good. Otherwise, the experience was good. Overall we were very pleased with our experience. Flights were on time, products and services were good, luggage came as expected and there were no significant inconveniences/hassles. We would consider flying China Airlines again.;For a round trip from San Francisco to Manila through Taipai, there were no major difficulties on all the four legs. Fare was resonable, planes were good, check-in was smooth, no problems with the luggage, seat, food, entertainment, and service all were fine. The only concern on Taipei to Manila leg was about restroom that was quite messy. We will again fly with China airlines.
✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Singapore via Taipei. Very unfriendly on weight for Business Class. We are first time travel on this Airline on Business Class which was recommended by Flight Center. We booked our Round the World all on Business Class, of course, a lot of shopping which resulted overweight for check in Luggage of 9 kg per person. Check in service insisted us to pay for the 9kg fees and later I had spoken to a friendly Supervisor but not much help. She manage to get us extra 1kg free only per person. We have no choice, open up luggage, throw away 8kg of stuff per person to made them happy but not us. We should have stick to our Singapore Kris Flyer may have avoided all these. China Airlines are too straight to Business Class, moreover, we are travelling Round the World. ;On our flight from Hong Kong to Singapore via Taipei, we faced problems with our luggage because we were overweight 9 kg per allowed limit for each person. Airline staff did not consider our request and we have to get rid of 8 kg per person to board the plane.
✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Los Angeles connecting at Taipei, with Special Assistance of Wheel chair for me. After alighting from CI 832 at Taipei around 7:00 pm, I was asked to ride a fully packed cab with similar assisted passengers to the Transfer Area. I had a carry-on trolley bag with me, which personnel carelessly loaded on top of three folded wheelchairs. As the cab speeded on way my bag fell off the cab hitting the airport floor. I did complain to the accompanying staff and expressed my apprehension of the damage to its contents, and also showed them the visible external damage to the bag. Upon arriving at home in Anaheim, on opening the bag I found more than three pieces of the souvenirs had broken, as well as the bag had cracked. Not only I feel dismayed and heartbroken as the souvenirs are irreplaceable here, and the bag was almost new. Because of their fragility I had decided to hand carry the souvenirs instead of checking them as checked baggage. This is all due to sheer negligence of airport staff at Taipei.;On the flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles via Taipei, my fragile souvenirs were shattered and the bag was cracked due to carelessness of the staff at Taipei airport.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Sydney on one of their new A350s. Boarding at started a bit later than scheduled, but we departed pretty much on time. About half an hour after departure, dinner was served - I went for the pork selection which came with a lot of side dishes. Very filling and delicious! Early the next morning we were served breakfast; I chose an omelette which came with fruit and yoghurt. The breakfast was tasty, though not as good as dinner. Arrival in Sydney was slightly early thanks to a strong tailwind, so we had to wait about ten minutes for our gate to be vacated by another aircraft. The legroom in economy was generous. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful, and were quite fluent in English. The onboard mood lighting was really neat, though I wish they used had the different colours on in economy more just like in premium economy and premium business. It was my first time flying China Airlines and I won’t hesitate flying with them again.";The flight experience was pleasant with on-time departure, good and tasty meal choices, enough leg-room even in the economy class, friendly crew, good decor, and early arrival. I would consider flying with china airlines again.
"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew Sydney to San Francisco via Taipei. Both flights were great; cabin crew, service, food, seat design, usability, and comfort (almost as good as SIA's business class seat and better than Lufthansa's or United), cleanliness, and punctuality (both flights left on time and arrived early) were spot on. As a bonus, clearing immigration at SFO, reclaiming our bags, and getting our hire-car were painless. Touchdown at 17:47, on our way at 19:15. The same process took us well over 3 hours a few years ago. They lost points for the wi-fi (too unreliable to be of any use) and the Sydney and Taipei lounges (reasonable, but more functional than welcoming with okay but not great food). Overall almost as good as you could want and extremely good value compared to Qantas and United Airlines direct SYD/SFO flights, though it does take longer obviously. But now we have an excuse to stop off on in Taipei on the way back to sample the dumplings.";A good flight experience in terms of seat comfort, meals and beverages, crew service, hygiene, and timing. The negatives include an unreliable wifi and lounges with limited food selection. A good value for money!
✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Fukuoka via Taipei. I booked China airlines as they were quite cheap. Check in was quick for the flight from Bangkok to Taipei, and this flight was 25% full, so everyone spread out and was comfortably seated. Boarding was smooth. I changed to an exit row after the doors closed, so no complaints on legroom. Seats were quite plush. This was a newer A330 and the seat had a touchscreen TV, USB charging point and a shared power outlet. Food on most of the flights were of good quality, although I went for the less appealing option half the time! The flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Service was relatively quick. On the flight to Fukuoka, we had a 45 minute connection, and walking distances can be quite long through Taipei Airport, so we were some of the last passengers to board. This flight used a 737 Sky Interior, which I must say has the worst bathroom.  This aircraft did not come with personal TVs but it's understandable as the flight lasted less than two hours. On the return flight, I flew from Osaka on their 777-300ER. On this flight, Premium economy was sold as standard economy, so I jumped at the opportunity and managed to get front-row seats for me and my mum. The premium economy seats look fantastic, have plenty of privacy, but I wouldn't choose them for a long haul transpacific flight. This is as the recline isn't too plenty and the hard backrest itself is a bit impractical.  On flights to Japan, I highly recommend their Sapporo beer. It's the best can of beer I've had in the sky! On the flight to Bangkok, it was an older A330 this time and didn't feature power outlets or usb ports, and the seat recline was broken on many seats, so it would recline or not stay reclined at some points on the flight. To sum up, China Airlines isn't a bad choice.;For the flights from Bangkok to Fukuoka via Taipei, the best thing was the low price offered by China airlines. The experiences were different on all the flights. On one of the flights, the aircraft was new and comfortable, food and service were good quality. In the older aircraft, the usb ports and power supplies were missing. On the whole, China airlines - a reasonable choice!
✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via Taipei. My flight from Vancouver to Taipei was smooth, the service was good though the food in Business Class was just ok. A350 is a good aircraft. However, the plane on Taipei-Delhi route was old and the seats were not that comfortable. Moreover, the lounge at Taipei was undergoing some renovations and there was a notice to contact ground staff for a voucher. The ground staff was not available in that part of the terminal and showed up 45 minutes before departure. On both my inbound and outbound travels, they had no idea about any such offer nor did they offer anything or apologize for not being able to provide lounge to business class traveler. For that reason alone, I will avoid traveling with China Airlines again.;In the route from Vancouver to Delhi via Taipei, my business class experience was just right. However, the lounge was not provided that becomes a reason for me to avoid China Airlines in future.
✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Auckland. Our flight was supposed to depart at 1pm. We sat on the plane until 2:30pm with absolutely no information or notification that the flight was delayed. Once they finally decided to announce the delay, we were told it would be another 2 hours minimum as “the plane needed to be inspected.” We were not allowed to get off the plane and no reimbursement was offered. So we are sitting in the plane 3 hours after “scheduled departure time” with 0 notice, reimbursement or options. Because the flight was delayed so long, by the time we arrived in Auckland it was too late to check into our accommodation, which was $198 wasted. When we brought this up to the staff they act like they have no idea how such a thing could happen. Do yourself a favor, pay the little extra and book another airline to avoid the holiday nightmare that 150+ of us all experiences on this joke of an airline.;Flying from Brisbane to Auckland, our flight was delayed for almost 3 hours. When we reached the destination, we lost checking in to the accomodation and the money was wasted.
✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Taipei. After a pleasant flight, this was the worst arrival I have experienced after millions of miles of travel. The flight arrived at the terminal just a few minutes late. There had been the usual pre-landing announcements but these were totally inaudible as the purser clearly had never checked the volume. Deplaning there was one China Airlines employee at the gate with a sign directing onward passengers to Fukuoka. This was gate D2 at the end of the terminal, and so it was a long walk to get to Immigration at the other end. Since I have a frequent visitors pass it took less than a minute to get through the formalities and I expected to get my bag and be on the way to my hotel within 30 minutes at most and just missing the start of the evening rush hour traffic. The wait for bags from BKK was interminable. I know Taoyuan can be busy, but after 40 minutes I had had enough. I walked the length of the baggage hall to the CI office. There I was told I was in the wrong terminal! This was totally unbelievable! I then had to walk upstairs, reverse the Immigration process and somehow find the route to Terminal 1. Once there, I was told the Immigration officer at Terminal 2 after voiding my arrival stamp should have returned my entry form which he failed to do. So there was a lot of phoning after which another form had to be completed. By the time I finally got to the the baggage hall, the carousel had stopped and my bag was the only one there. This whole nonsensical process had taken 90 minutes by which time I should have been in my hotel room. The Immigration staff at Taoyuan were efficient and only doing their duty. But for CI to have a flight arrive at the wrong terminal and then fail to ensure that every departing passenger was perfectly aware not only that they had to proceed to a different terminal but that each was directed very clearly to that terminal is an absolute disgrace. I will stick with TG and Eva for this route in future.;The flight from Bangkok to Taipei was satisfying but the arrival experience was terrible. The arrival was on the wrong terminal and it was not notified by China Airlines. I wasted a lot of time at the baggage hall and then told that I was in the wrong terminal. With a big hassle, it took me 90 minutes in getting to the right terminal and finding the baggage. I will instead fly with TG or Eva in future.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Ontario. They started the pre-landing safety check 7 minutes prior to the arrival time. No one checked the entire row of overhead bin above. The cabin crew finally finished the random safety check 2 minutes prior to landing. It was a long haul flight so I don't get why they pushed it to the last couple minutes and did it so rushed and irresponsible. I am thinking about flying with Eva air next time. At least Eva pays a lot more attention to safety issues.;For the Taipei to Ontarion flight, the cabin crew seemed quite careless and hasty. Although, it was a long-haul flight, safety check finished 2 minutes before landing.
Ontario to Taipei. China Airlines has a lot to improve. The boarding is the slowest I've ever seen. They just kept pausing the boarding. The cabin looks super nice on its official website yet it was actually not as impressive or comfortable. The seat was the crampest I've ever seen on a long haul flight, I kept moving my back cause it was really uncomfortable. The yellow blanket looks super used. As for the food, again, the worst I've ever seen on a long haul flight. Often I don't expect any nice meal on a coach class, but China Airlines really went too far. You don't even get a dessert like cake, only two side dishes. And the salad was a mess. You should not expect much for the snack in between the meals when flying economy class as well, but saltine crackers, what a joke. The restroom was kind of dirty. EVA, ANA, or Asiana all kept their restroom clean so I don't get why can't China Airlines keeps it at least not dirty. The service was okay, they are neither attentive nor rude. One last thing, just when we arrived at 5, I waited for my checked luggage till 6:30. The bottom line is you China airlines really has a lot to improve.;China airlines needs to refine their product and service. The boarding process was slow, cabin was not very comfortable for a long-haul flight, blankets seemed used, food quality was low, and the restrooms were not clean.
✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Amsterdam via Taipei. Don't fly this airline from Australia / North America through Taipei to Europe. Booked a Premium Economy flight from SYD to AMS for a personal trip. Premium Economy looked very good on their A350s. Only a week after booking they cancelled the SYD to TPE flight on the way out which when challenged, they suggested leaving earlier and having an 18 hour stop in TPE. I got them to book me a hotel, some meals and as the hotel was only for 12 hours, business class lounge access for the final wait, which took a fair bit of persuasion. Then a month before departure they cancelled the return TPE to SYD leg and caused me to stay yet again another 18 hours in TPE. At this point I had had enough but was too close to departure to try and find another Prem Econ ticket anywhere near the price. I tried to persuade them to upgrade me to Business so I could sleep properly, as I was now arriving on a workday and had to go straight to work. They just refused, even though the ticket price difference was 550 Euros, if I was to compare a fresh single ticket Business versus Economy. So they had to book the hotel and meals but this time refused point blank access to the Business Class lounge on the basis they don't run their own lounges in their main hub. Unfortunately, as a non-EU Carrier, they are only liable for delays on flights leaving the EU, so only 1 of the 2 delays was covered, although they are trying to ignore their responsibility at the moment. The planes are nice. The Premium Economy Seat is very big, and when you first sit down, with loads of leg room. However, to recline it, the seat goes forward - a lot! So much so that (and I am not tall, only 1.78m) you cannot fit your feet under the seat in front, so unless you are very short, the complete recline is useless. The food in Premium, unlike most other airlines, is pure Economy, and to be honest even more unappetizing than standard airline food. Their onboard service is questionable to say the least, even in Premium. For example, on 3 out of the 4 flights, they only produced a pre-dinner bar car once, and you had to keep asking for drinks, which might finally arrive. The inflight entertainment is pretty basic unless you are Chinese, luckily, I had a load of Netflix downloaded. All in all, I will never fly them again, and would suggest anyone tempted by decent pricing on tickets, particularly in premium classes, be very careful if flying long haul through Taipei (from Australasia, North America etc) - if the flights are not full, they will drop them and you will be stuck in TPE. Customer focussed - not on your life!;The flight experience from Sydney to Amsterdam through Taipei was unfavorable with China Airlines. First, they cancelled the first leg for which they made some arrangements then a month before departure they cancelled the second leg too. The customer support and service were not really good. The food and entertainment was just basic.
✅ Trip Verified |  New York JFK to Yangon via Taipei. I have flied so many times with different airlines from JFK to Yangon. But this is the worst experience ever. All my baggage are left at the transit. I can understand that that’s because of short transit hour and the airlines told me that’s normal for them. The problem is that I requested the wheel chair and no one picked me up at the transit. This is seriously ridiculous. I was awaiting the wheel chair until the last 5 minutes to the next airplane. This must be my last time taking China Airlines.;An annoying experience with China airlines. All the baggage was left at transit. Moreover, the request for wheel chair was not fulfilled.
✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Taipei. I had booked through KLM (who partner with China Airlines) and I had trouble to access my booking via China Airlines and therefore could not select my seat, which I found rather disappointing. This shouldn't be difficult to get right. The flight itself was very good. A  new plane with comfortable seats. Good leg space. Very attentive cabin crew. A lot of choice of movies and TV in the entertainment system. The food was good, although there was no hot chocolate, in lieu of coffee. An overnight bag with blanket, toothbrush and slippers was provided (which unfortunately is not standard anymore on long haul flights). All in all I would fly with China Airlines again, although I hope they improve the booking and check in process.;The booking process was disappointing while the flight experience was good with roomy and restful cabin, good service crew, tasty meals, and amenity kits.
✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Taipei. The flight was supposed to depart at 14:10 from Jakarta to Taipei, but it was delayed for 1 hour 40 minutes due to technical problem. No reconciliation provided by the airline for this delay to the passengers. Our first time to fly China Airlines, and disappointing. They shall not fly problematic aircraft unless that is all they can afford. Will not fly China Airlines anymore.;The flight was late due to a technical problem and no adjustments were made for the passengers.
Not Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. It was a new A350 plane, with a herringbone business class seat arrangement, meaning that everyone had a private, yet aisle seat. Seats were excellent, fully flat with convenient pockets to store things and wider than some others. The table for meals or laptops etc was very stored under the TV screen, and deployed directly towards the passenger, rather than swivelling out, which is a great improvement on other business class table layouts. The slippers and personal vanity bag contain nothing worth taking off the plane. Service was somewhat functional rather than engaging but a lot of the crew had little English. They were kind and helpful but not very interactive. Food was okay and substantial, but not exceptional. China Airlines seem to be able to leave and arrive at airports on time. All in all a great business class outcome if you aren't fussed about the food and service but want a great seat and on time delivery. The Taipei lounge is good also. Comfortable seats and food and drink on tap and a kitchen doing Chinese dishes on demand.;Business class seats on new A350 were comfortable. Airline is generally ontime. Lounge facilities and crew were good but food and passenger kit on plane were passable only. Overall good experience.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Gatwick. Really impressive service and comfort. I’m a tall person and still had plenty of leg room. The staff are friendly and helpful and attentive. If you are English speaking you may struggle a little as the airline is very Chinese focused. So language could be a problem. Not a big problem but have patience and humor. The airport at Tai[ei is fantastic. We were in transit both ways. The transit area is bright and spacious. For me and my wife, we had no problems. I’d happily go again, as soon as I’m over the jet lag. The food was excellent I must say.;Good food, excellent transit experience at Taipei and efficient flight crew. English speaking skills of flight crew can be an area of improvement otherwise comfortable experience.
"✅ Trip Verified |  
Vancouver to Taipei. Flight original schedule to depart at 2:20 am and due to mechanic failure, it was announced to delayed to 5:00am. At 5am on Aug 5, it was announced, it will further delay to 8:00am. At, 8:30am, China airlines announce they can not fix the problem and the flight is canceled. 5 hours of delay and only CAD$15 meal voucher provided. After 8:30am, I was arranged another flight in the next day 2:20 am. After that, no meal, no accommodations, no transportation, is arranged. Ground staff orally mention the compensation will be done while landing in Taipei. but it never happen. Complaint in Taiwan China Airline office. No compensation and verbally apology.";Mechanical failure delayed and ultimately cancelled the flight. Airline adjusted passengers on next day flight but otherwise no additional compensation for inconvinience despite verbal promise by ground staff.
✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Taipei. I have flown this airline several times and normally had good service but my last flight was a disaster. We were scheduled to leave Vancouver at 2:20 am. After no notifications the flight was delayed for one hour. At 4 am we were told it was now delayed until 8 am. After trying to sleep for a few hours on benches or the floor at 8:30 we were told the flight was cancelled. This was just the beginning. After going through customs and immigration (we never left the country?) We got back to the checkin counters and formed an enormous queue of approximately 300. They had 3-4 ground staff to attempt to rebook all of us on other flights as they were not sure that the aircraft would be ready to fly the next morning. Complete chaos ensued. There was virtually no communication between CA staff and passengers. Finally around 5:50 pm the last of us were confirmed on flights the following day. They begrudgingly gave a few dozen passengers hotel rooms with no food allowance. I lost 2 days in Manila, my final destination and was not offered any compensation for my prepaid hotel room. Overall a terrible beginning to a trip.;Unlike previous experience, the last flight from vancouver to Taipei was not good. Flight got delayed and then cancelled. Airline adjusted passengers on next day flight but otherwise no additional compensation for inconvinience.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. I was impressed with the comfort and service. The staff was very friendly, they were prompt with meal time and very accommodating. The take off and landing were quite smooth, and I was happy with how painless the boarding was. The food was pretty good, with enough in the meal to fill me up for hours. For economy class the seats were decently comfortable, and the leg room was more than I was expecting. I loved the touch screens and the quantity of movie choices. My overall experience was as comfortable and painless as a flight can be. I would recommend this airline to anyone looking to take a lengthy flight.;Comfortable and smooth experience for all processes in flight. Highly recommended for long journeys.
Not Verified |  Christchurch to Auckland. Have previously flown with this airline in Business Class and could not fault it. We flew Premium Economy this time and were very disappointed. The seats are very comfortable and lots of movies to choose from, but the food and service were average. We had flown from Brisbane to Auckland three days earlier and were fed Fried Rice - no other choice(s) that was it! Coming back it was chicken with mushrooms, rice and vegetables. It was OK, but under seasoned and very bland. My husband cannot eat mushrooms and he eats hardly any vegetables. When he advised the hostess of this she came back with a serve of garlic bread from Business Class. That was his meal! He has a healthy appetite and was not impressed. I would point out that the same meals were being service to Economy Class, so not effort made to provide something a little bit better in Premium Economy. Drinks service limited - one with your meal, and another one just after. That was it. I do not think they were ever offering spirits. They also did not come round offering water on a regular basis, as most airlines. Will definitely go Business Class next time - I do recommend that.;Unlike business class experience, premium economy is not worth the cost. The food is same as economy class. Recommended to use business class instead.
✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to London return. Both flights the air crew and ground staff were great. Food was pretty good both trips, and enough choices for entertainment, including a number of recent movies, although would be pressed to have enough movies to do two London trips in the same month. At the price point I think China Airways offers a great product and Taipei airport is big enough to happily spend time during transit. Point to note duty free shopping is not a bargain.;China airways is great value for money with good service crew. Transit airport in Taipei has good facilities to pass transit time.
✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Taipei. Reasonable price, good service, the staff were polite and helpful. Really surprised that we would have a meal even for the short flight. The food is pretty delicious. However bigger portion would be better.;Great service and offer meal even on short flight between Hong Kong and Taipei.
✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Taipei. One of the worst experiences I have had boarding a gate. Prior to boarding the gate I was hassled over my returning ticket which I did have. The boarding staff of China airlines were terrible they were forcing me to purchase another ticket. On top of that I am being told they will not allow me to board the gate, they will close the gate on me and that I would be sent home. I was forced to purchase a ticket that I will not use and cannot be refunded on now. All of my friends who flew out to Bali did not have any of these issues or forced to purchase a ticket going home. The absolute worst experience.;Had a very bad experience as i was forced to take extra return ticket by boarding gate staff. All other friends did not face this issue.
✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. Flight was originally on the 10th to London but rescheduled for the 11th because of a tropical storm heading towards Japan/Taiwan. I was upset because I was going to now miss the Semi final match between England and Croatia. I gave China airlines a ring was on hold for an hour (at this point I was ready to give up) and then was told at 10:15am that if I get to Sydney airport by 11am they would get me on an earlier flight and reach Taiwan before the storm does. So jumped in an Uber and was 5mins late. Thankfully I was put on an earlier flight as soon as I arrived! ;Orignal flight delayed due to weather. Contacting airline office by phone was difficult but they were helpful in arranging seat on earlier flight.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Denpasar. After a substandard flight from LHR to Taipei via Amsterdam, I was transferred to Bali. The transfer process in Taipei airport isn’t as easy as other major hubs as it involved a lot of stairs and lifts and a very confusing layout. The CI lounge in T1 was very crowded and it didn’t feel like a hub lounge for a major airlines, and when the main lounge was crowded they sent passengers to a small lounge which felt like a classroom. Outward journey: we left Taipei ontime. Boarding was easy and smooth. To my disappointment it was an old A330 with very dated interior. The seating was comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Entertainment was again very dated. Unlike my experience with their long haul flight, shortfall flights with China Airlines seem to be a different class. All the crew members on this flight was very friendly and approachable, and they didn’t stop providing any food or drink throughout the flight. It was indeed one of the best flights I had in terms of services. Landed in Bali on time but it was a long wait for the luggage. Return journey: check in at Bali was very slow but the agents were all very friendly. Returning flight was a slightly newer plan (A330). Service was again better than most of the long haul flight but definitely not as good as the outbound journey. Arrival at Taipei was very efficient. Quick immigration check and luggage was out within few minutes.;Good service experience on outbound flight but not the same on return. Aircrafts were slightly old and the lounges at Taipei was way over crowded.
"✅ Trip Verified |  OK service, issue with the planes I travelled London Heathrow to Taipei (with onward journey to Bali) in June with China Airlines. It involved a stop over at Amsterdam and the flight between London and Amsterdam was on KLM, while AMS to TPE was on China Airlines. Outbound flight left Amsterdam on time and arrived at Taipei few minutes ahead of schedule. China Airlines use new A350 for its European routes with the exception of Frankfurt. Once I got onboard I immediately noticed that the seat control panel wasn’t working. As a result there were only three possible positions throughout the flight – sit up, relax or flat bed. The table lamp was also disable because of this. I reported to the crew but they didn’t do anything until almost landing. Service was pretty efficient but not particularly warm nor friendly. Returning lag was slightly better. The CI lounge in Taipei terminal 1 was very dark and crowded until late evening. It was renovated 2-3 years ago but has started to show some sign of poor maintenance. The food and drink provided is substandard. Boarding was late by circa 20 minutes but the process was very easy for business class passengers. I was greeted by name by the cabin manager and the team which doesn’t always happen on CI long haul flights. Some of the crew members on this flight were exceptional. However I experienced problem again with the hardware. One of the toilets was out of order which means there was only one toilet for the business class cabin; the window shed in seat 14K was also broken. Seems to me that CI has a lot of maintenance issues. Overall it was a typical China Airlines long haul flight I’d expected. Nothing special and definitely not as good as it main competitor EVA. However the flight time suits me better (as EVA quite often involves a stop over at Bangkok).";Competitors have better service and lounge facilities but the schedule of this airline is better suited to requirement. Aircraft and lounge need maintenance.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Beijing. They were just doing their job. Very few ground staffs were there to help with the boarding. The flight attendants made no greeting when boarding and very limited interaction during the entire flight. The guy sitting next to me did not straight the seat back when takeoff and landing yet no cabin crew paid attention to it. The meal was okay. I am not picky about flight meal at all. A flight attendant sat on the jump seat with her legs crossed and stared into space after meal service. Together, the service was below average regarding Asia's airline but I would fly with China Airlines again if the ticket goes really affordable.;China airlines offered a resonable ticket price yet the service was substandard. The cabin crew were not attentive. The meal was right.
✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Taipei. As a mother travelling with infant, it was really hard time to keep baby feeling comfortable and didn't disturb to other passengers. But the flight crews helped me too many things during the flight. I do appreciate the cabin staff help. I would recommend about China Airlines. Good Service! ;A good flight experience from Los Angeles to Taipei with an infant. The cabin crew were helpful and supporting.
✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. As a family of 2 adults and a 14month old traveling to the UK, a balance of comfort and budget was important and after extensive research, I decided to give China Airlines a try since they’ve opened a 1 stop route SYD - LGW on brand new A350’s with a design awarded business cabin. I’ve flown business to the UK before with Qantas and Malaysian Airlines. Pre flight was simple with online pre-selection of meals, seats and free WiFi offer available but no limo service. Business check in counter and express path for security meant quick transit to the SkyTeam lounge which wasn’t as nice as the Qantas lounge and limited food & bev options. Priority boarding was available and once on board, the choice of the China Airlines business product proved itself to be a good one. The cabin and lighting is excellent, the flat bed seats/suites are modeled on Qatar and are spacious & comfortable. With an evening departure, our son slept with my wife for most of the SYD - TPE leg. A large screen with IFE including Pepper Pig kept him amused for the short time he was awake. Only downside was some language barriers with several stewardesses & western food was below average. TPE airport transit was straight forward with a modern comfortable lounge, baby room and showers along with good Asian food available. TPE - LGW boarded quickly again with priority boarding for business but once on board, the service stood out as better than the prior leg, largely because the cabin staff all spoke better English. The rules are more relaxed on this airline so letting our son play with his toys in the footwell area of my seat when he was awake was a big plus (Qantas would not have allowed this for safety reasons I suspect). Qantas also insist on making your baby sleep with the baby seat belt attachment on which is awkward and unhelpful when he’s already asleep. The food was also better on this leg and Pol Roger 2006 vintage pink champagne was excellent! Overall, My wife and I felt the seat product is superior to Qantas’ new business product which we flew to Hawaii in Nov. the in-flight service & food is inferior but here’s what the compromise gets you and your family, business return to London for 2/3rds of the Qantas cost or most other premium airlines prices. I’m a gold frequent flyer with Qantas but if they can’t get closer in price, I’ll be flying with China Airlines again for the next UK visit.;A good business class product experience with China airlines. The lounges were suitable with somewhat limited food selections. The boarding process was swift. Cabin's decor, lighting, and comfort was marvellous. The western food quality was low and there were language barriers between the passengers and the crew. I would consider China airlines in future.
✅ Trip Verified |  Flew China Airlines May 8th from Manila to Taipei. In my opinion their service is one of the best. FA's are very friendly and accommodating. There is no meal option for the flight but meal is superb. I had a great experience.;A fabulous experience with china airlines. good and friendly crew, limited choice for food but delicious meal.
✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to Taipei. Great customer service. We were late and they helped us through security and ran with us to show us the gate. Very friendly and professional, highly recommended. The food isn't the best but  is average. Drink service is nice (tea, coffee, water, wine). Lots of new movies, Hollywood and subtitled Japanese and Chinese as well.;an updated in-flight entertainment system, average food, nice drinks, and a friendly crew all contribute to an impressive customer service.
✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Sapporo via Taipei. Skiing trip over Easter to Japan, staff very friendly both in the air and on the ground. In flight entertainment was pretty good. Food and drinks were also pretty good, with the exception of one breakfast (western choice) which was not good, some combination of omelette, ham and pasta. All in all I would highly recommend China Airlines and already booked the next flight to London.;From Brisbane to Sapporo through Taipei, airline staff were nice, good choices for meals and beverages and, the entertainment experience was great.
✅ Trip Verified | Gatwick to Taipei was a pleasant enough experience. Check-in was easy, staff were polite and friendly and the cabin crew were accommodating enough. Taipei to Gatwick was a little disappointing but not terrible. Our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Cabin crew were pretty cold, very rarely showing a smile and we felt more of an inconvenience than appreciated customers. Food was ok, and whilst they would bring drinks when asked, they were often a bit stingy with amounts poured. If you go in with low expectations as I did I think you'll actually be surprised. Not terrible, but certainly not special.;A good experience from Gatwick to Taipei, with courteous and helpful staff, and good food and drinks. The flight was 30 minutes late.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Gatwick as my return journey. After a below expectation outgoing flight, the inbound flight was improved. Check in was smooth at a business class only counter. However the CI staff at the information desk was very rude to passengers making enquirers. Not a best representation of the company. It was very disappointing that as a business class passenger there is no dedicated lane for security and immigration. Security queue for both T1 (China Airlines) and T2 (EVA and China) tend to be long and neither airlines have special facilities for their business class passengers. The lounge in Taipei T1 (CI Dynasty lounge, the one closer to Gate A) was ok. It has no window but the design was classic. Food and drink choices were lacking. Boarding was announced in the lounge and there was a business class only bridge so you can skip the queue even if you are late at the gate. Service on this sector was significantly improved. I was offerred food and wine menu and was told that I should be able to change my food choice if I wanted to (I had pre-ordered online). The cabin manager introduced herself and offered a warm welcome. Again attention to details/amenities/food and drink were not as great as its main competitor EVA but this is partly compensated by the brand new airplane. Despite not offering full duvet and turn down service, sleep quality was good. The entertainment system also worked well. I personally found the onboard lounge on A350 a waste of space. I was told by the cabin manager that the lounge on 777 was larger and served its purpose and unfortunately it is not the case on A350. Business class passengers also only have 1 toilet (there are actually 2 but the other is frequented by passengers on deluxe economy). Overall the flight was a easy ride and we arrived at Gatwick early despite a late departure. It is not an overwhelming experience but it did work.;The business class experience was reasonable. For immigration and security, there was no dedicated business class lane. Lounges were fine but food and drink options were in a short supply. Cabin crew was welcoming and the entertainment system worked well.
✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Christchurch return. Legroom was the best thing about flights. Seat width was excellent. Head rests were comfy enough. On flight back I was on back row seat with supposedly no recline, but it still reclined nicely which was great. Bonus for back row seat: there was bonus small ov locker. All seats on return flight had curious addition of a mirror. Slightly useful. Flight service on first flight: except for one kind older staff all other flight attendants were rock-faced. English announcements not good enough. Crew were much more courteous & helpful on flight back. Piloting skills: inconsistent. First flight had way more turbulence. Landing was shockingly bumpy. Flight back was smoother with perfect takeoff/landings. IFE was ancient/laggy. Food on first flight good. Return flight food way too oily.;The seats were very comfortable. The food and crew were nice on one leg but just average on the other. The flight was turbulent and the landing was bumpy on one leg.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Taipei. I haven't flown China Airlines for 20 years primarily due to their poor safety record in the 90s and also due to lack of network in Europe. After they launched direct flight to London I decided to take the opportunity and fly  back to Taiwan for lunar new year. I booked it through online travel agent and it was easy. However China Airlines website is difficult to navigate. Menu pre selection is not shown on your main profile, and entertainment was on another website. Nevertheless the online check in process was very easy. At London Gatwick the ground service is handled by a 3rd party company. They are very courteous and friendly. The lounge was No. 1 at the South Terminal. Nothing fancy but did it work. Boarding was well organised as business passengers were invited to take a seat near the bridge. The flight in the business class section was empty. 8 passengers occupied the entire 32 seats. Immediate reaction was the airplane was spotless and clean, while service was lacking. They only offered soft drinks before take off. It was noticeable how quiet the A350 was - far better than 777 and it was very spacious. The entertainment was good - large screen, good choices of movie and a lot of interaction function. The seat was  comfortable. What fell short (well, when being compared with EVA which is its main competitors) is the ambition to deliver a full service. On EVA you have great amenity, pajama, great selection of wines and food and service was second to none. On China Airlines it feels they are just doing their job without going extra mile. The biggest disappointment is the layout of the A350. There are 32 seats but there is only 1 toilet in the front of the airplane plus one at the rear of the business class section which is often visited by passengers in Premium Economy. Overall it's a ok flight but nothing really stands out. If the price is right I will still fly with China Airlines as it saves few hours and I really like A350; otherwise I would prefer EVA Air or Cathay Pacific over China Airlines.";China airlines website is not user friendly. The experience was well over boarding, lounge, staff, cleanliness, seat comfort, and entertainment. The negatives include only one lavatory for 32 business class seats which was often used by passengers from premium economy, and the amenities and accessories were missing.
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew this route from Taipei to Penang a few times and always with China Airlines as it is the only company which offers this direct connection. However, it is always a painful experience, except the staff who is nice, the rest is really poor starting with the plane itself. It is a miserable plane with much too little space for a 5 hours international flight, this type of plane is usually used for domestic short flights only. Then there is no individual monitor and you have one poor movie playing for the all flight on a common screen. The food is low quality and this flight is usually always late ""due to the late arrival of the plane"". Only one thing is high is the price. It is actually so bad that I considered taking a Cathay Pacific flight with a stop in Hong Kong to not fly in this flying sardine can.";The staff was nice but rest of the encounters were painful. The plane was not comfortable enough for a 5 hour flight and there were no individual screens. The food quality was low and the flight was delayed.
✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Amsterdam via Taipei and was pleasantly surprised. Did not travel with check-in luggage so the only interaction I had with staff on the ground was at the gate. I checked in on-line and needed to get my boarding card printed. This was done promptly and I was directed to board the aircraft. Cabin in Business was clean, neat and looked well maintained. Cabin staff were very professional, used my name and ensured that I had all I required but were not intrusive. Sat in 12K on this leg of the journey, found the ambient temperature too hot, 180 degree flatbed was unfortunately wasted on this leg as couldn't sleep comfortably at that temperature. Arrived in Taipei with a 4hr wait, used the lounge which was comfortable and staff were pleasant, a few of them spoke English which helped. Used the shower facility which was clean. Boarded flight leg to AMS on time, flight left on time as did previous leg. Filled out my breakfast request, put my bed into flat position and fell asleep. Ambient temperature was lower and I slept really well, right through the dinner service. Was in seat 11A on this leg and was wondering to myself whether being in the second row from the front of the aircraft had any influence on the temperature. Seating starts at row 10 on China Airlines A350. When I woke up about 6hrs later, the staff were apologising for not serving me dinner, had to assure them that i was alright, they brought me biscuits and green tea. Several hours later after enjoying their In-Flight Entertainment, I was served my breakfast as ordered. Each and every interaction I had on these two legs were as one should expect of a business class cabin. Would probably fly them again if the same deal presented itself when I needed to travel.;The experience was pleasant. The crew were trained and served well. In one of the flight legs, the temperature was hot so I could not sleep. but rest of the journey was pretty comfortable with an enjoyable in-flight entertainment. If would consider flying with China airlines if a good package comes on again.
✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Delhi via Taipei. Really nice seats, good veggie food, polite cabin crew but the ground staff members at San Francisco are really rude and cant really understand English. The ground staff member at SFO didn't check our baggage in and it arrived one week late it was left at SFO, but overall the flight was nice.;The overall experience was nice with comfy seats, good food, and nice crew. We encountered problems with baggage.
✅ Trip Verified | Taipei to Frankfurt. Short term, only 8 days before the flight I purchased a very cheap ticket online with BYO. Australian ground staff was very polite and helpful to get some decent legspace for me. Stewardesses were very friendly and helpful, food was tasty and well warmed, requests for extra wine and a double gin and tonic was swiftly satisfied! Whilst the staff did not go around much offering drinks, they  responded quickly to requests. To my surprise there was no late dinner on the 13 hour leg Taipei to Frankfurt, but requests for some snacks, water and wine was quickly responded to in a very courteous manner. Both aircraft were very new, clean and both flights were without any turbulences. (Happens to me regularly on routes via China for whatever reason). I am very happy and will use them whenever I can in future.;The staff were nice and attentive and respond swiftly to the request. The meal was delicious and the aircraft was new and clean.
✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Taipei. Quite an enjoyable experience. Outgoing aircraft is in older interior and outdated PTV, very small and blurry. But the aircraft seemed to be properly cleaned and well-maintained. Incoming aircraft is in a new interior, new PTV but slightly less legroom. Food for both flight taste good, reasonable portion size, drink selection is a bit limited. Flight attendants are nice and professional.;A delightful experience with an older but well maintained aircraft on one leg and and a new one for the other leg. Food was fine, drinks were limited while the crew served professionally.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Sydney. The journey was highly enjoyable and memorable for all the right reasons. No queue at check-in, with excellent ground crew at check-in and boarding. Premimum Economy had priority boarding. The amenities pack included slippers, eye shades, lip balm, moisturiser, toothbrush/toothpaste and a hair comb. In flight entertainment was excellent with big screens and a large collection of recent movies. Staff were very friendly and professional. The Premium Economy seat is the best I have experienced, it reclines within the hard shell and the leg support lifts out the furthest I have experienced. Food was also high quality.;A memorable premium economy experience with smooth check-in and boarding, a good amenity kit, delicious meals, friendly service, and the comfortable seat.
✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Okinawa via Taipei. As a noticably pregnant woman flying with China I was disgusted with the staff. Not one of them acknowledged I was pregnant or bothered to help me get my bags into the overhead compartment, whenever I talked to staff there was thinly veiled contempt in their gaze, demeanor and voices. I was not a customer but problem. As an Australian I have never been treated like this by any other airline. On embarkation the cabin was thick with the smell of body odor, unclean, musty. The seats are crammed in like sardines and the food is disgusting. It was a read eye flight and they kept the lights on and fed us dinner at 2am when all I wanted to do was sleep, the flight was super bumpy and I did not feel safe with the condition of the inside of the plane surely making me wonder about the maintenance of the plane mechanics.;My experience as a pregnant woman was disgusting with China airlines. The staff were not caring at all, and the flight was not smooth.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Auckland via Taipei. Boarded in Rome, found my seat noticed a blanket on the seat not in a plastic bag. Opened it out and it was covered in black hairs. Found a flight attendant to ask for new blanket, and she said ""oh that's been used"" I had to ask for a clean one that came in a bag. The food was very bland I made the mistake and ordered vegetarian oriental, flavourless! The crew did not want to be there, they were remote in their expressions and service. When I asked for another water or apple juice they seemed annoyed that I asked. After the 9 hour layover in Taipei we were then directed to an Airbus A330 in my opinion far too small for a long haul flight to Brisbane. It was cramped, as in knees hitting the seat in front, and really uncomfortable. The on board IFE (inflight entertainment) screen was the size of a small paper back book, again not suitable for viewing a movie on a long haul flight. The crew were also detached on this flight as well. I don't expect the Crown Jewels when we fly but some sort of basic service is all one would expect. We would never ever fly China Airlines again, yes it was a good price but we got what we paid for. I feel I am not being harsh, I was a flight attendant for many years, service and a smile was number one priority.";We would never consider flying again with China Airlines. Although the price was cheap, but the basic product and service including crew was also low in quality.
✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Nanjing via Taipei. I was 6 months pregnant when I flew China airlines. My husband and I requested for the priority seat which has more space when we checked in, the assistant told us she selected the front spacious seats for us. When we arrive the airplane we found out she put us in the middle of 4 seats row, where it’s hard for me to get up and go to toilet. We spoke with the staff on airline for help and they are rude and didn’t help us at all. It was a 9 hours fly trip and my legs & hands are super swollen. I will not fly with China airlines any more. It’s a nightmare for me!;China airlines would not be our choice in future. Our experience was bad. We requested help from flight attendants but they behaved rude.
✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Sydney via Taipei. Do not fly with China Airlines - Just moved to Sydney with my friend where we left Dublin on the 3rd January and due to the airline we only arrived yesterday, the 5th so it took us 2 days when it should have taken 26 hours! There were delays on every single flight and when we got to Taipei we had to wait 14 hours to get a connection fight due to a delay in Amsterdam because the GPS on the plane was broken for 3 hours (sitting on the runway). When we arrived at Sydney we had no bags and were told they would arrive today, the 6th by 2pm, we still have no bags and it’s 9pm! When we asked to get seats together after sever delays this wasn’t even possible which was a joke! Worst customer service ever! I will never fly with them again!;The flight and the baggage service were delayed. The crew were not helpful, they didn't helped in getting our seats together.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Singapore. Cabin was dated but clean with seats with generous legroom and recline despite the presence of an entertainment box under all seats. Flight attendants weren't the most friendly but did their jobs well, serving refreshments and snacks. The food tasted pretty good, the chicken tasted fresh. Portions need to increase (they were about the size of my passport) IFE was very bad. It probably hasn't been upgraded since the day it was installed way back in 2005. Its resolution was so low that viewing a movie on it was torture. Its touch screen was so unresponsive that I had to literally jab it to get the screen to recognise my touch. Its only redeeming factor was its wide selecton of movies. Bring your on entertainment when going on CAL's regional A330s.;The flight cabin was old-fashioned but still clean with comfortable seats. The meals were delicious but portions were small. However, the in-flight entertainment system was too old with bad resolution but still it had wide options.
✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Surabaya. The staff at check-in was so rude. I asked for the front seat and she just replied “no more.” I knew the flight is not full, it’s just because she is lazy to re-print. Than she asked to weigh my bag, it weigh almost 11KG yet I traveled with 3 of us and 1 hand luggage. She said it should be checked-in also, but it’s all laptop & camera, how you check-in them? She and her colleagues were arrogant like see me like she was underestimating me. And then she changed my seats to the front lines.;The check-in staff was rude and arrogant in the flight from Singapore to Surabaya via China Airlines.
"✅ Trip Verified | My flight from Taipei to Okinawa was a pleasing one. But, the returning flight from OKA to TPE was indeed disappointing. No fault on the ground service, no fault on the fleet. Everything was fine except that the cabin crew serving the on board meal that day, they did not seem alert enough. She did not even notice she missed out distributing my meal to me. Even though the flight time was only 1 hour and distribution of meals needed to be completed fast, as a full service airline, they need to make an effort to come back and check to ensure every passenger received what they were supposed to. The ""I don't care as long as I have done my job"" attitude has pulled down my rating to this airline.";Flying from Taipai to Okinawa and return, the first leg was pleasant while the experience for the second leg was dissatisfying because the stewardess missed me distributing the food and did not check back again.
✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Manila via Taipei. Plane late in departure by about two hours without reason. My connecting flight wait time from TPE to MNL is also two hours so we got there just when my connecting flight is leaving. I thought that the airline would at least make up for part of the delay in the air. No, they did not do that. We landed in TPE exactly the time my connecting flight was suppose to leave, I noted that my connecting flight was delayed by half an hour. I thought I may have a chance of making it. Unfortunately, the airline staff did not help at all. From the flight crew to the ground crew no one helped at all. First of all they did not request arriving passengers whose destination is TPE to wait in their seat while people with connecting flight leave the plane first. Once I got off the plane, there was no staff to expedite me from going from one terminal to the other terminal. In the past they have provided car to transport you but this time there was none. The first staff I asked told me that I will miss the plane and to proceed to the flight counter to be rescheduled for the next flight. I proceed to the flight counter and I encountered a second staff who promptly told me that if I rush I might make my connecting flight. To make long story short, I did make my connecting flight by running and without any help from the airline. China Airlines service has really deteriorated as compared to the past. They were not the cheapest nor were they most expensive. I only travel with them because I am also a Taiwanese. I will look for other airline to take in the future. The service is just not there. I can get abuse by other airline for a lot cheaper price!;The staff was not guiding, helping and supporting at all. The departure was delayed. I had to rush for making my connecting flight. The service was really disappointing. China Airlines would not be my choice in future.
✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Kagoshima. This was a bland flight. From the ground to the plane the service was really standard, some staffs were good some were really bad. The staffs reveal this company did not train their staff really well. Some of their staff was not so professional and ridiculous. I would not choose China Airline again.;The service was just normal. China airlines staff did not seem well trained. I would not fly with them again.
✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Taipei. Economy class on the A350 and whilst a newish airplane, the service standards leave a lot to be desired. I flew the longer route to Taipei via BKK with EVA Air in June this year and this latest trip demonstrated why China Airlines are a long way behind them. The China Air staff, whilst courteous and pleasant, could not speak or understand English very well, getting drink requests and even the meal type all totally wrong. Their attention to checking the cabin safety during turbulence was also very poor and they appeared to be on a very lazy working system during this flight. Call button answering was very slow.Food was edible but little more to commend it. Seat had good legroom space, but seat cushions seemed very thin and hard. Choose EVA Air instead if you can.;The plane was new, the leg room was fine but seat cushions were very thin. The staff was courteous but could not communicate well in English. They were not very attentive.
✅ Verified Review |  Economy class flight from San Francisco to Bangkok return via Taipei. I had to cancel my initial flight at the gate and the staff were very helpful. The call center staff provided me information as to how to apply for a refund and book another fare. I was able to confirm my cancellation online and then book another fare confident I would be refunded my flight fare minus $100 cancellation fee. This is exceptional and one of the reasons I fly China Airlines. The fare was refunded within 3 days to my credit card. The boarding process is very efficient and the staff work hard at settling customers for on time departure and arrival. The seats are a 3 x 3 layout and with the person in front on full recline still plenty of leg room. The meal service is efficient with 2 choices for the main meal. The food on the return flight is better than the food from the USA. I find this the case on all airlines. The entertainment options are limited however there is sufficient choice to remain occupied. The toilets were maintained in a clean state throughout the flight. All requests were met promptly and there was no staff down on the flight. It seemed there were always enough crew available to serve customer needs. The flight to Bangkok was without incident. Smooth and the captain kept us well information. The return flight was less proficient. No warning of turbulence and often the seat belt sign was initiated well into the turbulence. The Taipei airport has reasonable facilities for a 5 hour lay over. Overall an excellence experience.;I had a great experience with China airlines on San Francisco to Bangkok flight. I had to cancel my flight for some reason. The staff helped me with the information. I was able to book another flight. The fare was refunded within 3 days. The flight was comfortable with good service, meals, entertainment, and clean toilets.
✅ Verified Review |  Kaohsiung to Bangkok on October 31, 2017 at 14:40. Check in between 12:45 am and 1:15 pm: I approached the front desk where a woman was serving. I had as usual already checked in online after the lady had already printed the ticket, put the stitch on my suitcase, she asked me if I had a flight from Bangkok and I replied to yes. She asked me for a ticket, but at that time I could not have the airport wifi, and she called the supervisor who in a rude and offensive manner to me, ripped the ticket and if I could not show it, I had to stay ground. Since the next flight was with Thaismile from Bangkok to Pennh, I went to the EVA air desk and they printed kindly the confirmation of the flight. China Airlines need more and more an efficient service and polite, friendly staff, what it wasn’t in my case. Right now China Airlines is no longer the only one to fly from Kaohsiung to Bangkok, I finally have the choice to decide with whom to fly: the next return to Kaohsiung will be soon by Thaismile.;My experience with China airlines was not good enough. The staff was indecent and behaved rudely when due to missing wifi signals I was not able to show the ticket. In future, I would have many options to choose to fly with.
✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Taipei. The Boeing 777-300ER was nice and clean inside, and seats quite comfortable. That is where the good part ends. The western food was simply terrible, and whilst the Asian meals were eaten by Chinese travelers near me, the western meals seemed to be left. Flight attendants showed no interest at all in the problems, and seemed very poor in being able to communicate in English which is a worry for other issues. Onboard entertainment okay, but this was all geared to Chinese passengers. The ticket I got was very cheap, but now I know why so cheap!;The aircraft was likable and comfortable. Western meal was not good at all. Flight attendants seem to be insensitive to the problems and could not communicate in English. The entertainment was Chinese focussed.
✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Kuala Lumpur via Taipei with China Airlines. Staff was very professional and friendly. Seats were comfortable for economy and entertainment was sufficient. Fruit plate meal was adequate. I have flown this route a few times and never had an issue. Price and times fit my needs perfectly. ;The flight experience was all good with cordial staff, comfortable seating, enough meal, and good entertainment. A good value for money!
✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei. I have not flown yet my trip will be this December 2017 to go see my daughter who is giving birth to my first grand baby. I have not flown overseas for a very long time so I wanted to make a good decision on the selection of the airline. When I called the 800-number I experienced exceptional customer service. In the past when I've called other airlines I get this feeling that I should be asking all the questions online and that I am bothering them.  The woman was very polite, took her time with me, answered all her questions and made me feel important. Thank you for going the extra mile and I look forward to traveling on your airline in a few months. I'm expecting that part of it to go well as well.;My experience was an outstanding cutomer service. I would look forward to travelling with China airlines again.
✅ Verified Review |  I flew the first leg from Newcastle to Amsterdam on KLM. Crucially both flights I took with China Airlines departed on-time. From Amsterdam to Taipei I flew on a more-or-less brand new Airbus A350 which was very modern, clean and comfortable. From Taipei to Nanchang was on a Boeing 737 which served its purpose for a short flight. The flight attendants were hard to fault on both flights given they were quick to respond to calls and very polite. The meal options were fine but I didn't like the fact they only had Chinese snacks available at the galley. However there was a full bar service throughout the flight and they were happy to keep serving both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks throughout the flight. Aside from the issue with snacks, the only other in-flight issue I had was with the entertainment system not having quite the range of audio and movie options of airlines like Emirates. The only seriously negative issue I had was the transit experience at Taipei Airport with the security area being far too small and lacking staff members meaning long queues. Also Taipei airport terminal 1 departures area was lacking in international dining and shopping options, which is disappointing given Taipei Taoyuan is supposed to be one of Asia's major hubs. However based on my overall experience I will happily fly China Airlines again.;The aircraft was up to date and comfortable. The flight attendants were responsive and polite. The meals were fine but the snacks were Chinese only. The entertainment selections were limited. The security area at the transit was too small and the departure terminal at Taipei airport had limited international shopping and dining.
✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to San Francisco return via Taipei. The ground staff were helpful and polite. The cabin crews might be one of the best , during my return flight (SFO - TPE) there was a passenger who got airsickness and  crew handled the incident very well. For the food it was also nice.  The price is very reasonable.;The reasonable price offered a great customer service and good food.
✅ Verified Review |  Manila to Taipei. Food was awful, the worst food I ever had. Service was very poor.  Flight was diverted to Hong Kong due to typhoon. We arrived at Hongkong around 10pm. They did not give us dinner. They bus us to our hotel which was about 45 minutes drive from the airport. We got there around 1:00am. Check in was completed at 2:00am. Then they infomed us we would leave hotel at 7:30am and the scheduled departure time of our flight was 1030am. Everyone was rushing to have breakfast and a lot did not even have breakfast. On the way to the airport one of the bus broke down on the freeway. We had to pick up the passengers that were on that bus. Flight finally left at almost 1:00pm. Did not feed us a thing. Then they gave us a food that was completely spoiled! Never again will I fly this airline. ;A terrible experience with the worst service quality. First, the flight was diverted due to bad weather and then on the way to airport the bus broke down.
✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Tokyo via Taipei. It was fine until I realized what was going on. Mind you plenty of space for all, food was fine, but when we first got to our seats in both long haul parts, they checked out tickets at least 3x. Now my daughter is multicultural and i am African American. So our alone tones are way apart. There was no need for 3/4 attendants to ask for our tickets. Families come in a variety, no need for all that checking.;We are a multicultural family. Our tickets were inspected at least 3 times. We did not like it.
✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Jakarta via Taipei. The trip was so easy from LA to with short layover to Jakarta. The first flight was about 14hrs, I was in economy class and even here who can feel so attendant quality of airline. Especially cleanliness of WC. I am tall and leg space was good so I could sleep without any problem almost all flight time. I used them also on the way back from Jakarta to LA, same great service. For the price they offer from LA to many destination you get top quality. ;A good value for money with a great service and comfortable seating.
✅ Verified Review |  Okinawa to Melbourne via Taipei. The Business class lounge in Naha is a generic lounge and very basic - think biscuits and instant noodles. There was a very large family group with many children filling up the Business cabin on the first leg, and both check-in and boarding processes were rather chaotic. This was compounded by an unexplained 60-minute delay in departure. On board the cabin crew were racing to serve meals and drinks to the packed Business cabin on this short flight. Service was, perhaps necessarily, rather abrupt. The seat was very comfortable, and my vegetarian meal was OK. Once in Taipei we had a short but pleasant sojourn in the China Airlines lounge. On the second flight the crew were efficient but not particularly friendly. The A330 seat was more comfortable than the one I had going in the other direction - not flat, but I was able to get a good sleep. My inflight screen didn't work for the whole flight. The vegetarian meals were large but a bit stodgy and uninteresting. The toilets were kept spotless. The leg from Taipei to Melbourne operated on time. I would fly China Airlines again if the price was right.;The departure was delayed and the boarding and check-in processes were disrupted. During the flight, seating was comfy and the meals were good. My entertainment screen did not work. The crew service was efficient but not friendly. With the good price offer, I would again consider journey with China airlines.
✅ Verified Review | This flight was cheap and offered good value. Check-in was fast and the Qantas lounge in Melbourne, while very busy, was a pleasant start to the journey. Onboard service was friendly and efficient. The cabin was spotless. On this A330 my seat, which was spacious and comfortable in the seated position, was angled and bumpy when extended, making sleep difficult. The IFE screen was small by business class standards, and my vegetarian meals were rather bland. The transit lounge at Taipei was pleasant. The refitted B747 on the second leg to Sapporo had more comfortable seats and larger IFE screens. The vegetarian meals loaded in Taipei were more tasty than the offerings ex-Melbourne. For the price and convenience on flights to Japan I would recommend China Airlines.;The flight offered a good value for money. For the price-convenience experience, I would recommend China Airlines.
"✅ Verified Review |  Penang to Los Angeles via Taipei. On our first leg of our trip home from Penang to Los Angeles via Taipei, I unfortunately left my tablet in the seat back pocket. It was within about 30 minutes after leaving the plane that I realized I had left my tablet. I went to the customer relations desk to report it and then when the staff came to the gate I again asked for their assistance. The lady at the gate followed up with me, before takeoff on the second leg, and indicated they had found my tablet and would put it on the next flight to LAX and to speak with the airline staff once we landed in the US. I have to be honest, in saying I was a little skeptical, but I provided my information to the staff at LAX and began to make phone calls the next day. Within a day and half I received a phone call from a young man at LAX that he had my tablet in hand. Thank you again to the young lady in Taipei and the LAX staff member for the extra effort in finding and delivering my tablet back to me.

";The staff was very helpful. I forgot my tablet in the seat pocket. With the staff's extraordinary effort, after a day and a half, it was handed over to me at the Los Angeles airport.
✅ Verified Review |  First time with China Airlines. Transited from Hong Kong via a Cathay A350 (see other review) and I wasn't expecting much. Lounge and boarding were not good. Poor quality lounge and chaotic inefficient boarding. From then on experience was top notch. A warm crew welcomed us aboard a beautifully outfitted business class.The seat was private, well designed and perfect for sleeping as the flight departed at 11.35pm. IFE was great, WiFi terrific, not a single complaint. Didn't eat dinner but the breakfast served was excellent. The crew bent over backwards to ensure everyone was happy and well looked after. Kudos to them. I'll ride their 350 over Cathay's any time.;The boarding and the lounge experience was disturbing but the flight experience was top level. The welcoming crew, perfect seat, best wifi and entertainment, and a tasty breakfast all made me consider flying with China Airlines in future.
✅ Verified Review |  A very reasonable fare from Singapore to Taipei. The cabin was clean, cabin crew was very courteous. Foods served onboard are great. My only complaints are the movie selections. The length of the legroom is reasonable for Economy Class, you get what you paid for. Would travel with them again.;Everything was fine with the reasonable price. The only limitation was a lack of selection for in-flight entertainment.
✅ Verified Review |  New York JFK to Taipei. One of the best in flight experiences that I have had.  The cabin was spotless. Sheets for sleeping. Excellent meals and in flight service. Bathrooms spotless during the flight. Excellent snacks and in flight entertainment. Great privacy, only one seat by each window and unique pods. Loved it and would fly with them again. Lounge at JFK only thing not great.;An excellent flight experience with great service, seating, food, entertainment, clean toilets.
✅ Verified Review |  Denpasar to Taipei. Late departure, premium economy is a shame. The service is horrible and the food was a complete disaster. It was definitely my last time traveling with China Airlines. Comparing to différent airlines, China Airlines are very far away from the quality standard. The multimedia service is terrible, old movie, bad quality screen, some of documentary are from 2000.;The food and service were terrible. The departure was late and the entertainment was bad.
"✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Denpasar via Taipei. Worst airline I've ever flown. This is the first time in my life where I was forced to check in a small carry-on, even though it weighed less than 10kg, then it was ""lost"" and never recovered. I spent my entire vacation without my clothes, calling the airline and the airport every day, and never got a single straight answer. They were incredibly unhelpful in trying to find my bag and have not found it in over a week. Aside from that, the seats are rather uncomfortable and meals less than average. On one of the flights they ran out of drinks within the first hour. The only saving grace is that there is in-flight entertainment with a good selection of movies.";I lost my carry-on baggage that was checked in. The airline staff was not helpful at all for finding my baggage. It was never found. The flight was very uncomfortable and the food was bland.
✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Singapore via Taipei. Terrible customer service. I had booked my tickets 2.5 months before my travel date and was only just contacted 3 weeks before I was due to leave through Expedia saying that there had been a change in my itinerary. My returning flight from SFO-TPE-SIN now had an 8-hr layover instead of a 2-hr layover because China Airlines was no longer operating their morning flight that I had previously selected. Despite my many calls to Expedia to mediate this with China Airlines over a week and a half, no appropriate options were given. China Airlines would give me a full refund, but not reimburse me for the higher ticket fares that I would incur since I would be booking just 3 weeks before my date. After exhausting every option I had, I had no choice but to accept the 8-hr layover in TPE. Their inability to provide any suitable options makes me regret that I ever chose China Airlines. This was going to be my first time traveling with them, and because of this frustrating situation, its left me not ever wanting to choose China Airlines. Their poor customer service and unwillingness to satisfy the paying customer is why I will never again fly with China Airlines.;I booked my flight with China Airlines and 3 weeks before departure, I had been informed that there were changes in the flight schedules. Instead of 2 hours now the layover becomes 8 hours for the connecting flight. No solution was provided by China airlines. The unsatisfying customer service exited China airlines out of my future choices.
✅ Verified Review |  A very reasonable fare from Tokyo to Hong Kong via Taipei on business class. I had flown this sector last year in March, now it is as good. Very courteous service and delicious food. Plane clean and IFE is decent with enough choices to keep one occupied. Transfer at Taipei, although a very close call of 30 minute due to delay from Tokyo, Hong Kong flight was held for the 4 of us from Tokyo, that was a very kind gesture! We had to run to the next gate though. The cabin crew were helpful to assist in settling us down with cold drink and hot towel. Upon arrival in HKG, our luggage did not make it due to the very quick transfer. However, on the next day, it was delivered back to my home with abundant apology. All in all, a very pleasant experience despite the hiccups. ;A wonder business class experience on a resonable ticket price. The crew was considerate and polite. The meal was savory and entertainment system was great.
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Seoul Incheon - Taipei, CI 163/162 and return. CI 163 was late departing Taipei by 45 minutes, so we left ICN about an hour and a half late as well. The return flight was right on time with no problems. I purchased an economy sale ticket, but was allowed to select a business class seat in the upper deck when buying the ticket for TPE-ICN. At online check in (T-24), a seat in the upper deck ICN-TPE was available for selection. There were two different kinds of seats. ICN-TPE was very very old recliner seat with old, old AVOD in the armrest (Exit Row).TPE-ICN was a newer shell seat that was not lie-flat. The food and service were fine. It was economy service with one tray of food and no special business treatment. I would not purchase these tickets for business, but would gladly pay economy and take the free seat upgrade.

";The flight experience was fine. The timing was late and I was allowed to choose a business class seat on an economy class sale ticket. The service and food were fine and was just like econmy, no business class treatment.
✅ Verified Review |  Flew San Francisco to Yangon via Taipei. I've been flying China Airlines for almost 2 decades. Their cabin services, lounge services and aircrafts have been improved dramatically in the recent years. With the new B777s and A350s, their hard products are phenomenal. English among crew has been steadily improving, but is still long way to go. Foods served onboard are great, especially, the flights originated in TPE. Cabin cleanliness is impeccable as crew clean up almost every 10-15 mins. For business class, they clean right after someone uses. I have flown their economy, premium economy and premium business products. They all deserve a high rating according to what you pay for.;Aircrafts are modern and service is improved for China Airlines. The economy, premium economy, and business products offer good value for the payment.
✅ Verified Review | Taipei to Auckland via Brisbane with China Airlines. Very nice and attentive cabin crew. Terrible legroom. Small screens monitors and not lot a large choice of movies and tv shows. No power sockets or Wi-Fi. Food choices were very limited (Asian food). Very thin blankets. Cabin and toilets were tidy during the flight. The stop in Brisbane is ok but you have to go again to security control (not the airline's fault, of course). Boarding in Brisbane was a little confusing (transit mixed with local passengers and the waiting room at the gate has a few seats).;The staff service was nice but legroom was very small. The vere small screens and very limited options for in-flight entertainment. No wifi and power sockets.
✅ Verified Review |  Flew China Airlines from Auckland to Taipei via Brisbane. Check-in wasn't very nice or professional, firstly they couldn't find the reservation on the system even when giving the e-ticket number. Secondly they said I needed to show my outbound airline ticket from Hong Kong. It seems to be a Hong Kong requirement but they only tell you that at check in that if you don't have it then you can't board. The A330 had very narrow legroom, the IFE had a small screen and movie choices, blankets were very thin, no wi-fi, no power outlets. Very nice cabin crew, food was basic (no mineral water if you asked for a glass).;The boarding was not smooth. During flight, the legroom was small, thin blankets, small screen, no wifi and power sockets. The crew was courteous.
✅ Verified Review | Hong Kong to Kaohsiung with China Airlines. Good waiting time at the check-in. Nice plane for a short flight like this and they give pillows and blankets. Very narrow room leg space. IFE ok. Very attentive and careful cabin crew. Boring safety film, nice meal for such a short flight. Always a very cold cabin temperature.;They provided a good meal, pillows and blankets on a short flight.
❎ Unverified |  Los Angeles to Yangon via Taipei. On board service was ok but this airline seems disorganized and not able to stick to a schedule. None of the flights I took left on time, or even close. Coming back from Yangon I missed the Los Angeles flight because they were so late leaving Yangon, which wasnt that busy. Spent 7 hours in Taipei airport and they comp'd me a burger king meal for the screw up. With a gift like that why even bother! I will avoid China Airlines in the future.;None of the flights were on time. I would not choose to fly with China airlines again.
✅ Verified Review |  Very bad experience from Taipei to New York JFK, use for the first time the premium economy class but it was a disastrous experience. Staff apparently not happy to work. Seat dirty, screen broken, meal didn't serve per my request. This is a most horrible airlines experience. I will not recommend China Airlines, my problem now is how will be the flight back from JFK?;The flight experience was one of the worst for premium economy with broken screen and a dirty seat.
"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Hong Kong via Taipei return. Me and my wife fly economy class, when we checked in at Hong Kong airport I asked the counter staff if there are any open seats at the front from Taipei to Los Angeles since our seats are the very last second, and was told it's pretty much full - however after transferred and board the plane, we found there are empty seats available. Two meals were provided on the flight, second one is cold and both meals are just very average in quality, taste and small in size. Since it was a might night flight, after the first flight the light was off and we are try to get some sleep, however it was so cold so me and my wife had to put on our coats and covered with a blanket, but still too cold so I went to asked the flight attendant and was told the air from outside is cold and the front cabin is ok. No dessert was provided on the flight, flight attendants have no smiles. I came from Taiwan and this was the second time I flew China Airlines Since I was moved to the US 33 years ago. I like Singapore Airlines, but 10 years ago they canceled the route, then I'm happy with the EVA Air. By the suggestion of a friend I fly China Airlines this time, and I was disappointed. My flight from Los Angeles to taipei was delayed 3.5  hours but was never notified, I found it out at preboarding one day earlier. At the airport I talked with another passenger and was told that she went to the airport on time and never got any notice.
";For my flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong through Taipai, the experience was disappointing. The cabin was too cold, food was average, and the crew service was not supporting and friendly. The flight was also delayed by 3 and a half hours.
✅ Verified Review |  Brisbane to Sapporo via Taipei. Check-in at Brisbane was prompt and professional. We were able to book our seats 6 months earlier, although this wasn't made clear to us at the time of booking. We made our seat allocations 3 months prior to the flight and could not get our preferred seating on the Taipei to Sapporo sector. No big deal. Whilst this flight leaves quite late - 11.15pm it gets in to Sapporo at a convenient time, for transfer to the ski fields in Hokkaido. The lounge China Airlines uses is the Plaza Premium Lounge - reasonable selection of snacks, limited choice of acceptable quality wines, average service. It doesn't feel like a 'special occasion'. Boarding is quick and again, professional. Juices and water are offered before take-off. Amenity pack includes lip balm and lotions, but of average quality. Seats are in a 2-2-2- formation in an older aircraft. The food, on both sectors, was the great disappointment of these flights. We have had better in economy on other carriers. The wine selection was of a good standard. The service is attentive and friendly. Entertainment options are average. The lounge in Taipei is of quite good, with a selection of snacks, hot cooked-to-order dishes.;The check-in process was smooth and proficient. The lounges were average and good. Amenity kit and entertainment was of average quality. The food was not good at all.
❎ Unverified |  New York to Hanoi via Taipei. Definitely a notch below other major airlines in East Asia in Business Class in every area, but I mostly want to comment on one thing. I thought it was very unusual when - on a 15 hour flight leaving JFK at midnight - they turned on all the lights in business class for the mid-flight meal and left them on for 3 hours. It was sure annoying to be woken up mid-flight for some little snack that I'm sure nobody would have even wanted if they hadn't woken us all up. And I don't recall ever seeing it happen on another airline. I asked if I could switch back to Economy where the lights were off so I could sleep, but she didn't get my sarcasm and went looking for a seat for me!! Also the lounge was overflowing to the point of not being worth it. Service was in general slow and confusing, and my entertainment system had a lot of bugs, but seats were up to standard.;The flight experience was not satisfactory. The seat was good but the cabin lights were kept on for a long time after the mid-flight snack, so I could not sleep. The service was average. The quality was below other major carriers.
✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Jakarta via Taipei. From Amsterdam an old A340,but with the 2-4-2 seating. Leg room on the window seats is obstructed by big entertainment box under seat in front of you. Online check-in on China Airlines website didn't work. Checked in at the airport and found out that my seat requests disappeared and was on standby, strange because I had a confirmed ticket. The information counter was helpful and could give us a window/aisle seat and we were told that for online checkin from Amsterdam Airport you have to use the KLM website (strange because I have CI ticket and not a KLM ticket). Taipei to Jakarta on a B777-300ER. Nice interior (bamboo wood, mood lighting, modern IFE). Again a full flight with a 1 hour delay. Jakarta to Taipei checked in online 24 hours before departure via CI app. Plane was a B777 and choose the row of 2 at the back of economy. The next morning we found out that the plane was delayed (3 hours) and that they changed the Boeing 777 into the A330. This A330 was old and tired (worn seats) and had seen better days. Cabin crew was friendly. Last flight to Amsterdam an A350, checked in online 24 hours in advance. Seats were already assigned and couldn't change the seats. All the seats were 'not available'. We went to the airport early (5 hours before departure) and tried to get emergency exit seats, bulkhead seats or last row seats but nothing was possible. The checkin agent showed me the screen and told me that it was all blocked. Got the impression that China Airlines give some of the customers more privileges with seat requests because during the flight we found out that the blocked seats (we saw on the screen) were empty middle seats, probably to give the passengers in that row more personal space (this happened with 4 rows in economy). The A350 is a beautiful spacious aircraft. Good seats, even when the seat in front of you is reclined. Big windows and good, modern IFE. 30 minute delay but we arrived 10 minutes ahead our schedule time at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.;The online check-in was not functional. The aircraft was beautiful and equipped with modern entertainment system. The seats were very comfortable. We felt that some customers get more previleges regarding seats.
✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Taipei, flying on a new A350 with China Airlines. The cabin was nice, but not cleaned very well - my table was sticky and the seatpocket had mess from last flight. I flew them one year ago, and this time the food is very low quality, small portions and choice was not available for either meal. Cabin attendants also seems much worse, this time they were not smiling once and as soon as tray was taken, the lights were out and staff disappeared. They could not understand or speak English properly either. I flew Eva Air from Taipei to US in last December, and their service is so much better than China Airlines. My flight from Amsterdam was cheap, but I will not use China Airlines again.;The flight cabin was good but not clean. The meal was not of good taste and quantity. The flight attendants were not friendly and lack Englisg language communication skills.
✅ Verified Review |  Taipei to Los Angeles. I have been calling China Airlines since December 31st about my luggage. I have been told many different things from many representatives but mostly just leave voicemails that never get returned. I was told today that all my other attempts at contact were never documented and so my bag was considered abandoned and sent to storage in Taiwan.;The worst service experience. My call attempts about my luggage were never documented and the baggage was stranded.
"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Taipei. The rudest staff I have ever encountered at a boardng gate, with the worst imaginable judgment. I flew into the LA airport from Minneapolis on January 2nd, about 3 hours before my China Airlines flight to Taipei, without a boarding pass for my flight to Taipei because Delta could not issue the international passes. I checked in to the China Airlines business lounge, who recorded my name and flight information and instructed me to wait until the Taipei flight was announced before picking up my boarding pass at the gate. When the flight was announced an hour later, I walked to the gate to get my boarding pass and was told that I was 5 minutes too late. they had awarded my business class seat to another traveler. (I reached the gate 40 minutes before takeoff, instead of 45 minutes.) I had paid roughly $3,000 for that business class ticket, had checked in with the business class lounge an hour earlier, and insisted that they let me board. The staff was unspeakably rude and insisted that I was wrong for being 5 minutes late, and that I must wait 24 hours for the next flight, and pay for my own hotel and other expenses. I remained at the gate complaining that it was unlikely that they could grant my business class ticket to another paying customer within 5 mintues after the 45-minute deadline. Then 10 minutes before takeoff, they told me they found me a seat. They claimed that a China Airlines staff had agreed to move to economy class ""as a courtesy."" Here is the punchline - the seat they ""found"" was my assigned seat, and they had given my seat to a China Airlines employee, and insisted up to the last minute that I must travel the next day. They had booted a paying business class customer so that an employee could take his seat instead. I am a regular customer of China Airlines, and service is normally okay, but this was one of the worst incidents I have encountered in 20+ years of business travel, and it was not caused by weather or technical problems.";My worst experience with the China airlines. My business class seat was delivered to another person within 5 minutes of being late. The staff behaved rudely. Finally, they let me in but it was one of the worst encounters.
✅ Verified Review |  This was a pleasant flight even it took nearly 2 hours transfer at TPE. The crew are very helpful - I really wanted to taste my own Choya Plum wine when the flight reached 30,000ft. Unfortunately the crew told me we can have the wine provided by airlines but not our own beverages. After that she brought over red and white wine. The seat are spacious and most importantly, A350 the new fleet comes with special Chinese painting design, great taste and a fresh experience. It was a full flight but we have never feel it crowded. ;The flight experience was delightful with comfortable seats and asthetic design.
✅ Verified Review |  Brisbane to Auckland. Considering the price and the quality of the service and amenities, this was a most enjoyable flight. Seats were very comfortable, especially for a three and a half hour flight across the Tasman, but weren't flat bed, so wouldn't be so good for long haul. Aircraft was spotlessly clean and staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was more than acceptable and we had nothing to complain about. All the other airlines crossing the Tasman during the Christmas holidays were asking twice as much as China Airlines. ;A faboulous experience considering the price versus quality with clean cabin, comfortable seats and great food.
Vienna to Denpasar via Taipei. China Airlines is pretty decent and the price was really good. We had a great experience considering the price and only a 3 hour layover. The seats were pretty beat up and a bit small, but leg space was good and service great. Taipei Airport had free wifi and ok alternatives for food. Inflight entertainment was lacking, with a very old small screen, but we didnt use it because we had our laptop to watch movies. The seats on the first plane did not have any headrest, but the second plane had it. I would not mind flying again, realising of course that companies like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Singapore Airlines are much better.;The overall experience was fine. The entertainment system had a very small screen and was lacking in selections.
Frankfurt to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines. The first leg from Frankfurt to Taipei was during the night and the cabin of the brand new 777, was perfectly illuminated in a warm color. Even the walls of the galleys were not grey or white but painted like bamboo wood. It was a great atmosphere. The bathrooms had a big size and were clean. On the second leg to Sydney, it was an older A330 and there was nothing special. But it was also a nice flight.;In the trip from Frankfurt to Sydney through Taipei, overall experience was fine but in the first flight aircraft had a great ambience.
Shanghai to Taipei with China Airlines. Very straight forward, for the price and timing you can't complain. The cabin crew were friendly and went the extra mile to speak English gaven that my Chinese is limted to 5 words! The seats were worn, TV very small, food seemed interesting (I wasn't hungry so I politely refused when offered). I was only on the flight for 1.5 hrs so it really didn't matter. The only inconvenience was the smell of the cooking from the galley. It was a bit of a nuisance however the friendliness of the cabin crew overwhelmed the smell. In all - for a cheap business class ticket it is good - plus it has a great benefit when checking in as you can use the Business class counters which I strongly recommend as the queues of people checking in to Eco on China Airlines is long!;No complains for the cost and time of flight. The cabin crew was warm and cordial. The seats were old and the screen was small size. Only, the smell of food was the cause of inconvenience. Overall, fine.
This was my return flight from Sydney to Auckland. Check-in at Sydney Airport was very easy with no queue at all. When I got to the gate, I was delighted to see that the aircraft had arrived from Taipei on time, so everything was looking good for an on-time departure from Sydney to Auckland. Alas, things didn't go that way from then on. They were having problems refuelling the aircraft, and our departure time kept getting pushed further back. We eventually took off 80 minutes late, and didn't make up time enroute. A330 was newer with a larger seat-back screen and a more comfortable seat. I ordered a gluten-free meal and that looked to be better than the regular meal. The crew were efficient, and spoke very good English. Considering the low price I paid for this flight, I would travel on China Airlines again.;The flight departure was 80 minutes late due to fueling issues. Everything else was great. The aircraft was new with comfortable seats and a big screen. The crew service was good and the meal was interesting.
This was my first time trying China Airlines for the short 3-hour flight between Auckland and Sydney. China Airlines seems to have a problem with being on time, and this flight was delayed a little, but made up the time in the air. I had checked in online, but didn't see the empty Internet Check-in line until after I had waited in the regular line for about 15 minutes to check-in. The aircraft was one of the older A330s. The leg-room was quite tight, and the seat-back screen was small. There was a good selection of movies and TV shows to watch though. I ordered a Gluten-Free Meal and it looked better than the main meal being given to others. The crew were friendly and had very good English. Overall, a perfectly satisfactory short flight, timed at a very convenient time for me, and at a great price.;The flight was not on time. The aircraft was old with a small leg room and inflight entertainment screen. However, the entertainment collection was good, gluten free meal was nice, and the flight attendants were courteous and fluent in English. A satisfying experience for a great price.
✅ Verified Review |  Auckland to Osaka via Sydney/Taipei. This was a really amazing experience. I must admit I had never flown with this airline before and was a little apprehensive, but I am very happy I did. Not only were they cheaper than my home airline by a substantial amount, but the food was better and the aircraft itself was certainly on par. The staff were polite and I would find it hard to fault the trip - and this was a long trip. I did the same route on the way back and again this was a very enjoyable experience. Again the staff were polite and helpful, the food was good and the entertainment certainly adequate. Thanks for the great trip.;A wonderful experience with China Airlines. The aircraft was modern and the meal was great. The flight attendants were gentle and kind. The entertainment system was good enough.
✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Auckland. Everything seemed unorganised. Passengers in front of us and behind us were moved because couples wanted to sit together and they were seated separately. A large proportion of us had no headsets for inflight entertainment. These were only handed out approximately 20 minutes into the flight with passengers, including us, asking 2-3 times for headsets. We also couldn't get the sub titles off our screen. The inflight meal left a strong odour throughout the cabin.;The things were not well organized. First, the passengers kept on changing their seats, then there were no headsets distributed initially during the flight. There was strong aroma of food in the cabin.
✅ Verified Review |  I flew with this airline on my last trip from Kuala Lumpur to Vancouver via Taipei. The advice I can give is for tall people book the emergency exits seats as their seats are small. For a 12 hour flight that was definitely very tight and exhausting. The movies selection wasn't that fancy but the picture and sound quality was bad. Their screen are so annoying very difficult to navigate around. Cabin staff was very attentive and pleasant though.;The legroom is less for tall people. The screen was difficult to use. The flight attendants were nice.
"✅ Verified Review |  
San Francisco to Bali via Taipei with China Airlines. Initially had some doubts about booking with China Airlines but I was pleasantly surprised with their service on all levels. Plane from SFO to Taipei was clean and comfortable. The second leg to Bali however the plane had definite signs of wear and tear. Entertainment on the plane was great. Would fly again.";The experience was pleasant. I would fly again with China airlines.
✅ Verified Review |  Taipei to Amsterdam via Bangkok. I flew twice this year with China Airlines, once in business and one in economy, the aircraft is the oldest. Everything looks old. Old seats even in Business class. The check in ground staff in Taipei is very kind but non initiave. The lounge in Terminal 1 is amazing, one of the best lounge, food, beverage, ambiance. The boarding is quite efficient specially for SkyPriority. The seat is ok but looks old, entertaiment screen is not good and the earphone is very uncomfortable. Good service on board, food ok, beverage ok for economy. I think for a national carrier should be better. ;The service experience was good. The lounge was amazing and the boarding was smooth and swift. There is still room for improvement since the aircrafts were quite old.
I chose China Airlines because of their nonstop flights between Tokyo Narita and Honolulu, the fact that they are part of Skyteam, and because their business class fare was more than a $1000USD cheaper than their partner, Delta. The service onboard was wonderful and attentive.  The food going was very good, on the return mediocre. The seats are not lie-flat. They are the most uncomfortable seats I have ridden in quite a while. They aircraft is very old and dated and doesn't have that Asian carrier newness or niceness at all (although their new A350s are supposed to be going to Europe). The AVOD was less than exciting but had enough to distractions to occupy me for the 7.5-hour flights each way. I would consider flying them again in the future if the aircraft were different or renovated.;The service was remarkable for the price. The food was good. However, the aircraft was quite outdated. I would again consider China airlines if the aircraft is renovated.
Taipei to Okinawa RT. Flight was on time, and I was upgraded to Business Class for this one-hour flight. Planes used are old 747s, but not that big of a deal as the flight is so short. Staff was friendly and professional. The only negatives were the lounges and food on board. China Airlines lounge in Taoyuan's T2 serves processed cheese cut into triangles. Quite pathetic. They really need to up their game. Lounge in Naha is a small shared lounge full of crying babies.  Food on board is a savory wrap served in foil from a bag.;The best was the cool and friendly staff. The limitation was lounges with limited food and space as well as the food onboard.
"✅ Verified Review |  Having flown with US airlines multiple times, I flew China Airlines once and was more than impressed. I was pretty lucky to be able to fly on an almost brand new aircraft from Shanghai to Taipei. The cabin interior was very fancy. Despite getting a middle seat, I still found the seats to be very comfortable, and am certain that I would have a great experience if I were to fly with them on a long haul journey. The food was not bad for airplane food, but still you can't really expect much from an economy class meal with any airline.

";The experience was impressive. The aircraft was latest with fancy decor. The seat was comfortable and the food was fine.
✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Auckland with China Airlines. This is my 4th trip with CI52/51 over the Tasman. Booked ticket 2 days before flying and received special fare of $300AUD return. Excellent value - 30kg bag, food, drinks, entertainment, seat assignment included, mobile check-in and dedicated bag drop - no waiting. Flight was full, left on time and service began swiftly and efficient. Arrived on time but delayed 20 mins while waiting for gate in Auckland. Return flight was also full, great service, excellent value.;A fabulous experience with a discounted fare, good baggage capacity, nice meals, great entertainment, and swift and smooth check-in.
✅ Verified Review | Taipei to Hong Kong with China Airlines. The flight was 2 hours delayed but I was lucky enough to get upgraded to business class. The captain announced that due to the Hong Kong air traffic control, we need to stay on the ground at least 2 hours and wait for the further instruction. All the cabin attendants were very patient and polite. The cabin manager kept apologizing to me. The meal was served on the ground which was cool and not something I've ever experienced before. Overall, everything went well even though it became a late night arrival. Great customer service.;A wonderful customer service experience with nice and polite crew. The flight was two hours delayed. The meal was served on ground but it was great.
✅ Verified Review | Taipei to Bangkok with China Airlines. I'm a frequent flyer. I was very lucky to fly the newest aircraft B777-300ER with special Boeing livery. Cabin manager came to greet me as usual. The inside of the aircraft was very clean and new. The Premium Economy seat was comfortable. The flight attendants were very polite and nice. A very smooth flight.;A good flight experience for premium economy. The aircraft was new and clean. The crew was nice and the seat was comfortable.
✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Penang via Taipei. I am a passenger on wheelchair. When I was on transit at TPE airport, after waiting for more than 3.5 hours, I asked the ground staff if they can wheel me to the boarding gate so that I can wait there. One of the ground staff young ladies told me that since I can still walk, I should walk there myself! When I complained about her attitude at the transit counter, the ground staff there told me that I can go and complain to the management about this. I'm not going to travel China Airlines anymore if I need to transit in Taipei. The ground staff are rude. ;The ground staff were not supportive and behaved rudely when I asked if they could wheel me to the boarding gate. I would not fly with China airlines in future.
✅ Verified Review |  Manila to Kansai via Taipei with China Airlines. Trip was a pair of 2 to 2.5 hour regional legs, both in the same aircraft. (There was a 3 day layover in Taipei between the legs.) Older style business seats, lie flat at angle, in 2-3-2 configuration on a 747-400, perfectly sufficient for 2 short daytime flights. Exquisite, attentive service. Stir fry black pepper beef, glass noodles, and a glass of Chianti Classico was probably above average, but this was only a 2 hour flight.;The service was superb. The seats were old but still comfortable. The meal was good.
✅ Verified Review |  This was my first time flying China Airlines from Singapore to Surabaya and return the next day. I was very impressed by the excellent onboard service, provided by the friendly and welcoming cabin crew. Both flights were on time, check in process was smooth. There was only one meal option on this fifth freedom flight but it was delicious. The cabin crews served with a smile. Overall I enjoyed these flights and will fly with them again soon.;The check-in process was swift, the flights were on time, meal options were limited but food was tasty and the cabin service was great.
Manila to Tokyo Narita via Taipei with China Airlines, and I was surprised with the service, type of aircraft used and the Value for money. They served hot meals and they also have inflight entertainment. What can you ask for a real value for money? Service was very good going to Taiwan and to Narita. Food was not that good, though. Overall, if i have to decide between a budget airline vs China airlines, I would choose China airlines.;My flight with China airlines was a good value for money. The food was average but the service was awesome.
"Taipei to Tokyo Haneda. Boarding smooth and well organised. Aircraft definitely showed its age with old looking interior. Tiny personal touch screen, so tiny it's really hard to watch movies. Average inflight entertainment selection. Meal was your typical aircraft meal, you eat it because it's there. Nothing to wow about. Seating space very small. I'm only 5'5"" and my knees were against the front seat back. Crew friendly and attentive. Great that China Airlines is getting the new B777 fleet and product, but a complete revitalising is needed.";The flight experience with China airlines was just average. The boarding process was fine but the seating was uncomfortable.
Taipei to Bangkok with China Airlines was a late night flight on the first sector of the Taipei to Amsterdam service. All good, comfortable, easy flight, pleasant and efficient crew. It is far better than it used to be : this was my first China Airlines flight in about a decade and the improvement is very evident. Skyteam membership makes this airline a good choice on some sectors.;From the last decade, the China airlines has improved alot. The flight was comfortable and smooth and the service was fine.
San Francisco to Taipei with China Airlines. Have not taken this airline across Pacific Ocean for many years. Although we flew in coach, the seat was comfortable for a trans-Pacific economy class. Services was good, much better than Delta coach we flew from Tokyo to Seattle on return. Flight attendants were polite and helpful. The plane was new and their three-seat family arrangement is genius. Safety record of this airline improved dramatically. Cabin crew are cognizant of safety requirements much more than 15 years ago. Flight entertainment system is more than enough, especially for those with Chinese language capability. Being a Sky Priority member, we zip thru check in line with no problem. Long lines of TSA security check at SFO airport was not fun.;Flight experience with China airlines was better than Delta. The check-in was smooth. The crew was nice and supportive. The seat was comfortable, seat arrangement was good, and the plane was new. The in-flight entertainment was good enough.
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Los Angeles with China Airlines. Outstanding service and comfort at one of the best prices for this route. From the ease of check in and priority screening at busy BKK to the attentive service and comfort in business class, China Airlines will be my first choice to SE Asia. I flew over to ICN on American first class and had a surly flight attendant the entire route. China Airlines exceeds American in detailed service and overall comfort. The food choices on CI were good and better than the food I was served on a JAL flight. The entertainment system was easy to use and there were several new movie options. But for me the most important factor was the comfort of the lie flat seat with adequate privacy. No stepping over someone to access the aisle. Bottom line - great price and excellent flight. ;The best service and convenience at the best price. From check-in to food, entertainment, comfort, seating, everything was first-class.
I feel obliged to write a review of China Airlines. The airline itself is fine. The food is fine, the service is fine, the seats are fine. However, every single time I fly this airline it is late. I have flown the Taipei to Hong Kong route a number of times in the past six months, and every single time, at both ends of the journey, my plane is extremely late. It is frustrating to be told on a Friday night that your 7.40pm flight to Hong Kong is delayed three hours. It is even more frustrating to be told on the Sunday night that your flight back to Taipei is delayed 2.5 hours. In this particular case, the flight was over 3 hours late, instead of arriving at 10pm, I arrived at 2am. I will be flying Cathay Pacific from now on.;Whenever I flew with China airlines, the flight was always late creating alot of frustration. The inflight service and experience was fine.
Taipei to Bangkok on China Airlines Boeing 777. Premium economy seat is a very good choice for short-haul alternative to business class. Good entertainment system, big table (but somehow strangely tilted), good noise-reduction headphone. A good enough seat, reclines, but not electrical. China Airlines food is edible, flight attendants quite good.;A wonderful experience with china airlines premium economy. The flight was pleasant and enjoyable.
Christchurch to Melbourne with China Airlines. Awesome service with lovely staff and great food, movies and comfortable seats. Thank you very much for excellent service. I would definitely be using again. It was clean and well airconditioned. Value for money. Checking was great and no hassles. ;A great value for money experience with China airlines. Everything was clean and organized, and great service.
China Airlines from Melbourne to Christchurch. Value for money, great food, cabin crew courteous, all services were included in the price so booking was easy, also for xmas was able to layby for a week so made it affordable.;A good experience with nice meal, friendly crew, and affordable price.
We flew with China Airlines for the first time over Christmas new year break from Brisbane to Auckland. We were pleasantly surprised, the check in service was exceptional. We asked to be upgraded to business and it was complimentary. The service in air was sufficient and seats comfortable. Meals fairly basic but catered for my dietary requests. Its not Qantas business class standard however we would happily fly again with them. ;The flight experience was surprising. The check-in process was swift, service was good, seating was comfortable and the meals were according to the request.
Flew China Airlines 1st January from Taipei to Fukuoka. The inflight service was good and prompt by smiling FA. Individual movie screen as small, as ipad mini. The flight was good, cabin and toilet clean and well maintained. Will recommend flying with China Airlines.;The cabin was clean and the crew service was sufficient.
Flew 1 Dec, CI 752 from Singapore to Taipei. Full flight departed on time, service was good and prompt by smiling FA. New uniform looks smart for mature staff but makes the younger ones looks older. Individual movie screen as small as ipad mini. 9 Dec, CI751 from Taipei to Singapore. Boarding was chaotic. Flight departed late due to long queue to take off. Both flights were good, cabin and toilet clean and well maintained. Will recommend flying with China Airlines.;The crew was friendly and responsive but the check-in was disorganized and the flight was late.
Amsterdam to Bangkok with China Airlines. Pleasant check in by KLM. Aircraft not young but cabin and toilets spotlessly clean and well maintained. Appeared to be fully booked, cabin crew adequate, bright, smart and helpful,  speaking Thai. They regularly offered water/juice. Food and wine not outstanding or huge quantity but okay value for money, served effectively - the pre-booked meals came out first. Plastic cutlery but good quality. Entertainment- not a vast amount of audio on offer, range of styles good and well chosen but control system impenetrable and  difficult to operate. General impression good overall. Seat pitch minimal but no footrests restricting floor space so you can stretch out.;The flight experience was good. The aircraft was old but well maintained. The food and beverage offers were frequent. The service was nice.
Pretty nice medium-haul flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei. The crew on this flight were attentive and helpful, but a bit robotic and I have missed a bit of a personal touch. The seats were not ful flat, but for this route very comfy and spacious. The meal service were great with a good choice of asian and western style foods. Coffee service was very nice with a metal milk can and sugar box. At arrival in Taipei there was no priority line at immigration, so it tooks a long time to get landside.;The crew was supporting, seats were comfortable, the food was very good, and coffee service was exceptional.
China Airlines  from Amsterdam to Taipei via Bangkok with A340. I was positively surprised after this return trip. Despite the relatively older aircraft that they use on this route, it was a comfortable flight with good IFE and food. The crew on board were very helpful and service oriented.;The flight was pleasant and comfortable with a friendly and responsible crew.
New York JFK to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines in economy. I select China Airlines because they always seem to have the cheapest fares on this route, probably because of the long 18 hour transit in Taipei. JFK to Taipei leg had a new Boeing 777-300ER which was quite nice with good IFE and reasonable comfort and room, even on a 95% full flight. One flight attendant made it quite clear that she would rather be somewhere else and detracted from the other crew. Always a hassle trying to arrange the transit hotel on arrival in Taipei as the transfer desk seem to know nothing about it, despite it clearly being in your booking. Not sure why they use a 3 star hotel (Taoyuan Hotel) 30 minutes from the airport for this purpose. Taipei to Sydney leg on much older A330 that was a full flight and fairly uncomfortable. Food was on par with other airlines. Would use again if they continue to have low fares.;The overall flight experience was good with a low fare. The first leg of the journey was comfortable while there was some inconvenience in arranging the transit hotel. I would again consider China airlines if they continue to offer low fares.
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Taipei with China Airlines, and I was very impressed by the new Boeing 777 Business Class. The seats were really comfortable, you have so much space since the 1-2-1 configuration and lots of spare room for your travel utensils. The food was good, as well the inflight entertainment with a huge touch screen and a good range of new and old movies. The cabin crew was really friendly and helped with anything you needed. Would recommend for long haul flight between Asia and the USA.;The flight experience was wonderful. The new aircraft with spacious and comfortable seats, good meals and entertainment, and a friendly crew were impressive.
The China Airlines lounge in Taipei airport is very beautiful and comfortable. There was a short delay so I stayed a little bit longer. Pleasant flight from Taipei to Ningbo. Cabin crew did a very nice work. The meal was great and wine taste good. Very comfortable seat and great selection on the entertainment system.;The China airlines lounge was magnificent and the flight experience was comfortable and awesome.
Hong Kong to Taipei with China Airlines. Check in procedures were smooth and window seat reserved okay. Just had enough time to take a coffee before boarding. In flight light meal was fine and movies were updated. I was allowed to carry 2 hand carries (one laptop) other than a checked-in baggage. Inflight service was friendly and appropriate. Baggage was on the carousel waiting for pick up as I went thru the immigration check point. A pleasant flying experience.;An enjoyable experience with China airlines with smooth check-in, good seats, nice food and beverage, and baggage handling.
Hong Kong to Taipei return with China Airlines. The flights were on time and no delay. Cabin service was good for both flights. On the trip from HKG-TPE, some passenger picked up wrong baggage which is my baggage, I contacted the China Airlines baggage counter and my baggage was found on 2 hours later. The service is good.;The service was good with the help of which I was able to find my lost baggage. The flights were timely.
I do not recommend flying with China Airlines. I arrived 8hrs late and they lost my bag. I was making this trip to coming back Bangkok to Madrid via Amsterdam. They do not give the two boarding pass that I needed when leaving Bangkok, and when I arrived to Amsterdam I cannot find anybody to assist, the check in was closed, so we have to take 2 flights later to arrive - and when we finally arrived the bags were lost. Worst experience ever.;An overly unpleasant experience with lost baggage and delayed flight.
China Airlines delayed flight by over 14 hours, which kept me at TPE over 15 hours. Prior to flight, I was notified of the delay and I attempted to call China Airlines telephone numbers in different countries so I could make a flight change to the next day and avoid the extreme layover in TPE. None of the phones were answered in any country. I tried using Expedia to contact China Airlines. They also attempted over six different locations but China Airlines do not answer the call. I finally gave up, flew to TPE, and stayed in the airport for 15 hours. I asked China Airlines to provide an overnight hotel in TPE, but they refused that request. This is totally unsatisfactory as a customer and in the future, I will make every effort to use another airline.;An unsatisfactory customer service, delayed flights, careless service, and no overnight hotel for transit. I would not fly with China airlines again.
Always 1 hour late! I took 4 flights with them in August. The first second and third flights were 1.5 hours late. The last flight was 3 hours late with no explanation. If tardiness is an issue for you when flying, do not fly China Airlines;All the flights with China airlines were delayed.
Originally our flight was on August 9th from Taipei to Hong Kong and connecting flight to Haikou via Dragonair. However due to the Typhoon it was not only chaotic at the airport but many of the flights were cancelled or delayed including ours. We let the ground staff know that this would be a problem as it meant we wouldn't be able to catch our connecting flight. They were extremely helpful and able to arrange for the 3 of us to fly directly from Taipei to Sanya instead. Very grateful that they managed to solve our problem efficiently. ;The flight was delayed due to stormy weather. The cabin crew was very helpful in solving our problems.
Check in was fast and staff was helpful. The seat was narrow for a guy around 170 cm. However the recline angle was good to sleep. The cabin staff was nice and try to look after passengers during the flight. The food was fair,  but the quantity was enough for an adult. Overall, I enjoy this flight and it met my needs.;An enjoyable experience with a smooth check-in, helpful staff, good service, and fair food.
Hiroshima to Taipei return. Staff on the plane and ground were helpful and friendly. I found the seats reasonably comfortable. The food was good and we were supplied with as much water and tea as we wanted.;The experience was fine. The food was good, crew were supporting and friendly.
Shanghai Pudong-Taipei Taoyuan on brand new B777-300ER, ground service handled by China Eastern Airlines which was a disaster. Flight delayed 1.5hrs which is very normal in China. 3-4-3 layout of economy is so uncomfortable even for this short journey, normally airline put 3-3-3 layout such as SQ/CX/BR. Food is ok, only coffee and tea available, even no juice. AVOD is very good.;The flight was delayed and the seating was uncomfortable. The food was ok and the entertainment system was great.
"Traveled through Taipei one day after a typhoon, flight CI6. China Airline staff, normally on top of things, were flat-out paralyzed. Nobody was in charge, desks were barely staffed, flights were moved between gates w/o notice. Stewardesses complained they had been stuck 15-20 hours without any information as to what they were to do or when. Our plane was ""delayed"", then ""cancelled"", then ""on time"". ""We have no flight crew available"". Suddenly there was a big rush to board the plane about 1.5 hrs after scheduled takeoff, then we sat at the gate for over 4 hours, ""wait for more passengers."" After having crammed every seat, the plane left the gate only to sit on the runway for another 1.5 hours. Finally got off. First meal was cold. Nobody could make any decision, they all milled around. Very poor crisis management, and utter failure to have a plan.";The worst experience with China airlines. The poor decision making and crisis hadling by airlines management made everything a failure.
The services of China Airlines ground and cabin crew are good, staff are nice. The cabin seats were clean and comfortable and aircraft looked new. It provided variety movies for passengers. The cabin crew served drinks and hot meal. The flight departed on time and whole flight was stable and nice. ;The aircraft was pretty new and the flight experience was smooth with a clean and comfortable environment.
The flight was smooth, flight attendants were nice, seats are comfortable, food was very nice. There were no delays. ;An enjoyable and comfortable flight experience.
I was looking forward to trying CI on my next trip but ended up feeling a bit disappointed with the overall experience. All flights were full which meant no space to spread out. Greeted harshly when boarding, directed to seat. Aircraft was modern and clean. Seats quite close together. My knees were touching the seat in front of me, and I'm not tall. Crew rarely smiled, and didn't appear friendly or approachable. Food of decent quality for economy, drinks limited. Water was warm and served from strange plastic jugs, which makes me think we were drinking tank water. Service was rushed. Entertainment was of very good selection and easy to use. No drink or snack runs until breakfast served.  No amenities however bathrooms kept clean. Crew friendlier on return flight but nothing above average. If the price is significantly cheaper it may be worth flying CI, otherwise I'd spend a bit more and fly with a different airline.;The flight experience was average. The aircraft was modern and clean. The entertainment and food was fine but drinks were limited. The seats were not comfortable and the flight was full.
Left on time and arrived early on both flights! Inflight entertainment was good, food was your average plane food but nothing was nearly as bad as it was made out to be. My flights were significantly cheaper and I would fly with them again.;The flights were on time and the fare was quite cheap. I would fly with China Airlines.
The seats are definitely not geared for Western heights and weights. My husband was tortured with no legroom for 13 hours. It was just not comfortable. Might be ok under 5 hour flights but for long distance travel its brutal. The staff were accommodating. Food was pretty bad and I actually didn't know what some of the items that were served. I left a lot. Not sure I'd fly this airline again because of the cramped uncomfortable seating. That's really all they have to offer.;The seats were very uncomfortable and actually not enough to accomodate western heights and weights.
Return flight Penang-Taipei in economy. Aircraft very old and aircon leaked no PTV seating uncomfortable food fair (a cooked meal). Cabin crew on outward flight fairly friendly but on return flight unfriendly. No flight information supplied. Flight only four hours plus so bearable.;The plane was very old, seating was not comfortable but the crew service was fine.
MNL-TPE-SFO return. MNL-TPE on a new A330. Good service new plane poor food. 11 hour layover at TPE allowed family to explore Taipei prior to connecting flight and enjoy the local fare. TPE-SFO on a refurbished 747. Full flight and ticket class meant seating in the tail section with no USB port and a bumpy ride. Service below average with only one drink/water run after meals on this 12.5 hour flight. IFE above average to good. Returning from SFO used the same aircraft but this time seated in the midsection. USB port barely working and so was the underseat power. Meals small and barely edible. Service was friendly and prompt but again only one water run in the long haul flight. Took this flight only because the price was almost half of DL PR and OZ. If price point is the same then and only then will I consider flying CI again.;The overall flight service experience was average. The food was not good at all, drink offers were limited. The entertainment system was good. The power sockets were not functional.
My first trip flying CI on a bargain fare to NRT. Great service on the ground and in the air. The cabin crew were friendly and worked hard on a very full flight. They would often check and clean the lavs even the Purser put on her gloves and went to work. Great meals and IFE. Seating was a little tight in the Y cabin but a very pleasant trip otherwise.;A pleasant journey with China airlines with nice food, entertainment, and service.
Feb 26 CI 584 PVG-KHH. Mar 10 CI 503 TPE-PVG. Flew on CI flights at least once every year for my last 36 years and I tried last month again on PVG-KHH and TPE-PVG. Everything was excellent. You find the crew to be sincere and try their very best to help at all times. A333 was used for the outbound flight full dinner was served although it was just a 1.45 hr flight and arrived on time. For my return flight I was on the special livery B744 and I discovered the cabin is pretty new. It is rare to see IFE was offer on flight between China and Taiwan in fact CI is one of the two airlines out of 10+ carriers serving cross strait having PTV on every single seats I am for sure to fly CI again for my next trip to Taiwan and looking forward to try their new B777 business class next time.;An excellent flight with helpful crew, great food and entertainment. I would fly again in future with China Airlines.
Travelled JFK-TPE TPE-ICN TPE-XMN and finally back to NYC. It was a month long vacation & those flights definitely made it more pleasant. The lounge at Jfk was well stocked with food & drinks. Plenty of staff member s to clean after the moving crowd. On board the flight attendants were all smiles. No request was too much for them. 3 meals served from JFK to TPE are delicious and fresh & the drink menu extensive. The lounge at TPE airport is one of the best in my opinion. I recommend China Airlines highly.;Everything from the flight experience to airport lounges was enjoyable. The staff was smiling and the meals were great.
SUB-SIN-SUB in Business Class. Aircraft: A330-300 (2-2-2). Check-in at both airports was fast. All departures and arrivals were on time. Seat is comfortable with decent legroom. Food had a better taste on the outbound flight and drinks filled up frequently. Flight Attendants were charming and friendly. Unfortunately I did not use the IFE so could not comment on it. For those who want to enjoy Business Class at affordable price (almost 50% cheaper than its competitor) I recommend you to try it and personally I do not hesitate to fly CI Business Class again in the future.;An enjoyable business class experience at a reasonable price. The check-in process was smooth and swift, seat was comfortable, food was good, flight attendants were nice and caring.
I have been traveling between Asia and North America for more than a decade more than half those flights have been on China Airlines because of the access to LAX and SFO. This last trip I returned to SFO for nine days before returning to Saigon. Firstly the food service is timely after takeoff but being served a meal suitable for a baby. Two tiny scallops and rice with four green beans The next meal service isn't available for 10.5 hours. Make sure to bring snack food for yourself. Secondly the airline asked me to check my carry on bag at the gate which I did. At gate 9 in SFO the man there took my bag and said you're all set to go. Yep I was but my bag wasn't. Have no idea where it is. All because it was over by a kilo. Doubt I'll be flying China again for a very long time.;This time the journey with China airlines was not good. The food servings were too small. They did not allow my bag because it it 1 kg overweight.
CI0004 from Taipei to San Francisco old B747 with narrow leg space I am not tall just 170cm. The screen is terrible small in size and cannot see much on the screen even though I adjusted the light to maximum. The appearance of the crew was nice however the service was below average only serving drinking water for 2 times during the entire 11 hours flight. No more China Airlines for the flight which longer than 4 hours.;China airlines is not suitable for a long-haul flight for over 4 hours. The entertainment system as well as crew service was not good at all.
FRA-TPE-DPS on 747-400 and 330-300. Boeing cabin refurbished and fine Airbus new aircraft. Leg space sufficient food and IFE not convincing but friendly staff and plenty of drinks refill also alcoholic beverages. TPE airport quite old facilities with insufficient bathrooms. Overall OK for the money spent would do it again.;The experience was good enough on a new aircraft and plenty of beverages servings.
Shanghai Pudong-Taipei Taoyuan on new B77W the lounge at Pudong is disaster (China Eastern lounge) 3-4-3 layout of economy class cabin is really uncomfortable friendly cabin crew and wonderful IFE hot lunch served for this 1hour 20 minutes journey. Back Taipei Songshan-Shanghai Hongqiao on old A330-300 still clean and we'll maintained again very nice cabin crew and good lunch served wonderful lounge at Songshan airport with plenty of hot food and drinks.;The flight was comfortable, staff was friendly, entertainment was enjoyable, and the food was good.
Christchurch to Sydney return on business class. It is a very poor business class offering from this airline. Purchased a promotional fare from their website to try this airline while they operate this route over the summer season. Few days later I was contacted by the airline asking for more money as the fare on the website (which we have seen advertised for at least three weeks) was apparently incorrect. Of course I refused to pay more and after few emails and phone calls we came to a resolution but the whole situation was just badly handled. On the return flight from Sydney check-in agent was outright rude telling us we are not given any lounge access as we paid cheap tickets. In general it was a bad experience from the airline which is trying to break into this route. Never again!;The business class experience with China airlines was very bad. They asked for more money because the one advertised on the website was incorrect. Further, they did not provide any lounge access.
I fly CI for my annual trip to Bangkok from Calgary. It's an interline route using Westjet from YYC to YVR and China Airlines for YVR-TPE-BKK and return. They continue to use the old tired A343 for YVR-TPE lag which is showing its age although preferable to me due to the 2-4-2 configuration as I tend to pick a window seat. I am finding their service is going downhill over the last four years especially for inflight entertainment and the meal. The meal from YVR was stale and inedible so is the breakfast on the TPE-BKK and TPE-YVR leg. Brand new B777-300ER for TPE-BKK which had great cabin and IFE interface. Fair value for money but service could be a lot better for the money.;The food and service were lacking and unsatisfactory. It could be a good value for money with improved service.
I booked a round-trip flight from LAX to Saigon last October. The flight from LAX was delayed 2 hours. Before landing in Taipei for a connecting flight to Saigon the flight Captain announced Connecting flight to be 12.30pm instead of 10.30am as scheduled. After we landed there were no China Airlines staff members to be found. Our group of passengers finally stumbled upon a security officer who directed us to China Airlines' counter on a separate floor. Long lines and only 2 overworked employees helping us to get the connecting flight. Contrary to the flight crew announcements the connecting flight was scheduled at 2.30pm not 12.30 as announced. Adding insult to the injury China Airlines gave us a meal ticket in Taiwanese Dollars worth about $3USD not even enough for a hamburger. Due to this poor service I would never fly China again.;The service was terrible. The meal ticket was inadequate. The flight was delayed and long lines on the counter. I would not fly with China airlines in future.
All of my flights were pretty much on time and my luggage didn't get lost but my experience was that this airline offers no frills. Unfriendly staff with poor English skills. Tired cabins and dirty toilets. Poor quality food and such a dated and difficult entertainment system. I bought a cheap ticket so I guess I got what I paid for!;The cheap ticket offered a cheap flight experience in terms of food, entertainment, old cabins, and crew service.
"SIN-TPE-SIN. Both ways it was an older A330 - seats were a torture for a 185cm guy like me. My knees hurt being constantly pressed against the seat in front so I had to stay in very uncomfy position and/or stand up frequently. IFE was horrible being an old plane what you get is a not more than 6-7"" screen and no matter how you play with brightness and or screen position you won't see much. Resorted to music in the end. Games were slightly newer. Cabin crew were nice but their English command was poor. We all know that you get what you pay for but we also know that nowadays in airlines world that is not entirely true. There are very good and cheap carriers operating in Asia. China Airlines is not among these in my opinion. At least not on Singapore-Taipei route.";A poor service experience with China airlines. The seats were uncomfortable with a small legroom, the aircraft was old, the entertainment system had a very dim and small screen. The flight attendants were good but with poor Engish communication skills.
NRT-TPE-BKK - Have not flew CI for sometime and was bit dubious. What an improvement CI has made. Both on the A330. The flight were on time good selection of inflight entertainment. Food was okay for economy and better than KLM's Business Class intercontinental. The thing I love about CI was the option to view take off and landing real time on your screen. I cannot fault the trip and service whatsoever.;A great trip with China airlines with timely flights, good entertainment options, fine food, and adequate service.
Flew KIX-TPE-BNE return trip at the beginning of September 2014. Seats on the TPE-BNE leg is new. The ones I flew specifically were B18360 on the outbound journey and B18358 on the inbound journey. The interior of the these birds is upgraded compared to the other A333 in their fleet. The seat recline was 170 degrees and the feeling was very similar to the business class seats on the Garuda A333 fleet. Food on the outbound leg was fabulous. I do travel regularly but it was one of the best meals that I have ever had on a plane. Sleeping was no problem as the seat reclines to 170 degrees or more. The food on the return leg was lower quality but what can you expect on an inbound flight? The seats were the same as the ones going there and we did have a wonderful night's rest. To sum it up I am very satisfied with my travel experience and I look forward to my next flight on C class with CI!;A very satisfactory experience with China airlines. The aircraft was new, the seating was very comfortable, and the meal was the best.
We have flown eight segments with China Air over the last few years. The last flight was last week. Never on any flight have we left the gate on time. On the last segment Taipei to Bangkok. The steward said they had to shut down the video system. I was watching a movie. Around 45 minutes later I asked them to reboot the system or turn it on. They could not do it. Several stewards tried to no success. The food was served and the trays were left on the tray stand for about 45 minutes. So anyone wanting to go to the bathroom had a problem. They had bright lighting on well into the night. overall a poor flight. One seat we had was broken you could feel it in you back anytime you moved it would make a loud noise. Very inconvenient for us with all the late leaving flights and quick transfers. We tried this airline over United where we really felt the service and planes were very substandard. I really do not see much difference.;The flight service experience was terrible. The flight was delayed, the entertainment system had problems, the lighting was very bright even during night time, and the food trays stayed on the seat tables for a long time, causing alot of inconvenience.
CI916 and CI8 July 31. I traveled from Hong Kong to LA. The check-in service is not as good as I expected. She confirmed me in an exit seat but I found I was in the last-narrow row seat. The only thing I was not satisfied with was the seat space. China Airlines does not give as much as leg and feet space as other economy's for the last row passengers. The food - ok. The cabin - ok. Maybe I will choose China Airlines again but I will not recommend to my friends and families.;The service was just mediocre for check-in, seats legroom, and food. The cabin crew was fine.
Flew LAX-TPE-HAN in refurbished 747 to Taipei and A330 to Hanoi. I was very impressed with the 747 as the seats in economy were very comfortable even for the entire 14 hour flight. The crew were very friendly and happy to help. The food was okay but its airplane food so what can one expect. The flight to Hanoi was almost empty so we were upgraded to premium economy. We were served an entire lunch on this flight even though it was only 3 hours. Then flew from HCM-TPE-LAX. 747 on both flights however the plane for the TPE-LAX flight was older. The entertainment system was outdated and barely worked. The seats were also uncomfortable and left me sore after the first 5 hours. I would recommend China Airlines great value for your money and they seem to be taking passenger comfort into consideration with their updates.;The flight experience for the first journey was quite comfortable with the new plane even for the long-haul flight in the economy class but for the return flight, the aircraft was old and the experience was not much comforting.
Flew from Brisbane to Honolulu (stopover in Taipei and Tokyo) on CI53/54 and CI17/18. All flights on A330-300 aircraft (Brisbane flights had upgraded interiors). Have flown with CI previously but was impressed with the high standard of food on all trips. Drinks so-so with less variety of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and cabin crew were reluctant to give the entire can of soft drink unless requested (and had to ask other colleagues for permission to do so). That being said service was great for the most part and most flights departed on time with minimal delay. As an end note I submitted positive feedback to the CI website and received a phone call from the Brisbane office within 2 days thanking me and asking if I had any further comments. Appears to be a company that listens to its customers and I will choose to fly with them again in the future.;I was amazed with China airlines service and high quality meals. Although the drink offerings were limited in choice and quantity. The flights were timely and i would consider to fly with China airlines in future.
Flew Taipei to Tokyo on 23 June. At the boarding gate the scanner wasn't working well to scan my boarding pass and the passenger in front of me but was overall smooth and didn't cause too much trouble. Inflight service was okay and crew members were friendly. Food was good and a lot of choices for films and music for a 3 hour flight. The cabin pursers announcement was difficult to follow. The most strange thing was that on leaving the aircraft there was no one to greet you at the door and in fact no crew member could be seen from my cabin.;The boarding was a bit chaotic not much troublesome. The service was fine with attentive and courteous crew. Food and entertainment were good enough.
We flew from Brisbane to Auckland on Business Class (I upgraded us last minute on the flight June 27th) - I think people are very harsh with their reviews as we had a fantastic experience.;A fabulous business-class experience.
AMS-BKK-AMS on CI late June 2014. I chose CI because of the great fare and the early arrival in BKK and AMS on the return flight. CI uses the A343-300 on this route. May not be the most modern plane but it has a very comfortable seating lay-out even when full like my 2 flights with ample legroom. Flights departed a little late but arrived ahead of schedule. Meals and service by the crew were much better than expected. The IFE is basic compared to Emirates but still provided for a good few hours of entertainment with an interesting non-Hollywood selection. All in all 2 fine flights for a great price. I will use this airline again.;The fare was very reasonable and the flight was good with comfortable seats, tasty meals, good entertainment and service. I would fly again with China Airlines.
On board service is absolutely minimal. Unfriendly staff no trace of hospitality at all. Entertainment: all music is Chinese only! No classical music at all (but Chinese traditional music in abundance). Inflight magazine in Chinese language (with some minimal English words added). Cleanliness is rather low overall impression: very low. The good things: flights were smooth and we felt safe. Punctuality was good.;The service was not good at all. The entertainment and magzine had all Chinese. However, the flight was smooth and on time.
"Terrible service all around will not fly with them again. Our flight did not even land in Beijing because of a ""weather"" condition but when I checked the weather at the time it was sunny. No other explanations were given. Upon landing in Beijing I obviously missed my connective flight to Harbin. They offered us a hotel and a good 3 course meal but instead we were transported to a rural area with only a cup noodle.";The worst service experience. The flight didn't land on-time due to weather condition and I missed my connecting flight. I would not consider China airlines in future.
Beijing to Shanghai Business Class June 21. Despite both ATC and weather delays (neither of which were the carriers fault) we had a really good experience. Flight was operated by an A330 which was internationally configured as it was continuing to Melbourne. Very comfortable seating good entertainment including camera's and maps and a very decent snack. Crew were efficient and kind although not overly warm and they were inconsistent in their enforcement of safety regulations i.e. Cell phones on and seat backs up. The female crews seemed hesitant to enforce correct behavior of Chinese men. All in all a very good professional experience.;A wonderful experience with China airlines. The seats were comfy, entertainment was nice, and the snacks and drins were adequate. The crew were attentive and the service was professional.
I did not have any service related problems with air china on return flights SYD-PEK-STO. Slight flight changes were emailed well in advance. I requested special meals which I got on all legs. Crew were very courteous. Some of the PEK-STO have inflight personal entertainment now but the selection is very poor and worst of all it is the same on all legs. Better to have your tablet or laptop pre loaded. If you are tall like me then don't choose a window seat. These seats and the middle two seats in the centre rows have a large black media box that sits where your left leg should - very uncomfortable on overnight flights. Overall a good experience minus any frills.;A resonable experience with good service, meals as per request, and the friendly crew. The negative was the limited and similar options for in-flight enetertainment on all legs of the journey.
My return flight from Changsha to Beijing was delayed 3 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight to LAX. No explanation apology or help to make the LAX flight. I was flying business class at great expense. This kind of treatment was most unexpected. I missed the flight by only 5 minutes and had I received some help at the gate I could have made it. Other airlines make the effort. Going back to rebook was very difficult with no help offered. On the later return flight to LAX the flight attendants were very poor for a business class seat but they did allow Chinese to move into open business class seats but when I asked to move to first class for my problems I was rudely denied by the international manager. The food and drink for business class was both cheap and poorly offered compared to other airlines business class. Last time I use this airline.;The business class experience was terrible. The flight was delayed causing the connecting flight to be missed. No help and supportwas offered for rebooking. The crew behaved rudely and the food and drinks were substandard for business class.
Lhasa-Kathmandu. May 10 2014. Inexplicably instead of flying directly from Lhasa to Kathmandu which would be a diagonal flight path with Mount Everest to the left of the plane we flew due south then due west and so I saw Everest from my window seat on the right of the plane. I had asked to change my seat to the left window but was told that this was not possible so I was glad that I got to see Everest after all! Otherwise an OK flight. Nothing remarkably good or bad.;The flight was just average. The interesting part was that I was able to see Everest from my window.
HKG-PEK-ARN / ARN-PEK-HKG. Surprisingly no delays at all. Flight attendants were impolite. Lack of ground staff support at ARN. Seats were narrow and really uncomfortable. Economical with respect to fare.;The flight was inexpensive but not comfortable. The staff were not supportive and courteous.
Short domestic flight CA1832 from Shanghai to Beijing on a A330 was great. On time. Brand new aircraft comfortable seats in economy class on board service with warm meal (even with the choice of two different ones) and good choice of non-alcoholic beverages. Cabin crew very attentive and worked as a well-trained team. As a LH frequent traveller I had never experienced such high level of service on some of the European flights. Simply great experience. Will definitely use them on a next trip from Europe to China.;The domestic flight experience was wonderful. A very warm and attentive crew service, modern aircraft, comfortable seats and nice meal and beverage options.
Flew from PVG to TPE. The flight was delayed 2 hours due to its late arrival as the aircraft had stopped in Hong Kong due to strong wind. Late arrival in TPE and late departure in TPE. All other things were perfect. I will definitely choose this airlines again.;The flight was delayed but everything else was great.
Unpleasant crew it's like you are talking to a statue. The seats were dirty (fresh sticky stains) and pillows and blanket missing - asked them twice. Seats are small and the box for the media is occupying the quarter of the space for your feet (half if its broken). They didn't want us to move on an other seat reserved for the crew (10 free seats never occupied). My wife was pregnant and I told them but they don't care. Asked for some water (twice) never came - I think they got angry at us somehow. On the way back we asked for a larger seat (emergency exit) but they put us in the middle between two persons. I am not a difficult person but this company is just inhuman.;The service experience was the worst. The crew was inconsiderate and inattentive. The seats were not spacious and cleaned.
"Currently waiting in Air China lounge in Beijing where the food is terrible and all the supposed ""cold"" drinks are warm. Flight has been delayed twice. Due to depart at 4.45pm now departing 8.40 no announcement this after a 3 hour delay yesterday traveling from Guangzhou where they loaded us and pushed back from the gate and sat there for 3 hours due to bad weather. Surely with all the technology available they know this before boarding us? I was traveling in business class which is far below most other airlines standards. Never again.";The business class was substandard. The flight was delayed twice without notification.
LAX to Taipei in Business Class and Taipei-LAX in Economy. Renovated 747's both ways which was a vast improvement over the older product. Food and wine selection in Business was excellent and the staff were very attentive. Food was good enough for Economy but plentiful again the staff was excellent. The only thing that needs a slight improvement is the IFE I wish they have more selections for recent movies.;The aircraft was renovated, food and cabin service was perfect. The enetrtainment system was not updated with recent collection.
Sydney to Rome return. My tv screen did not work. Asked staff several times could I move and they just kept resetting it. Majority of the consoles did not work properly. Very poor movie and food choice. But the worst part by far was then they added a 3rd destination without our knowledge. Major confusion increased because it was a domestic leg added. So had to check out of the airport and back in at both Beijing and Shangai. I tried calling their complaints department but conveniently you can only email and its been 2 weeks and no response.;The flight experience was not good. the entertainment screen did not work at all. the food was also bad. Another destination was added without notification.
SFO-PEK-MNL. The flights were better than expected based on past reviews I read. The food was fine and the kid's meal provided for my son was much appreciated. The FA's were not overly friendly but polite and efficient. I particularly liked the beverages made available in the galley. It was nice to be able to get up and get something to drink when needed. The FA's kept it well stocked with water soda tea and juices. The inflight entertainment could have been better. The movie & TV options in English were limited and aged. However they still gave us something to do during the flight. The provided headsets were not very good but we brought our own for the long trip so it wasn't a problem for us. Overall I was satisfied with Air China and appreciate the money saved when compared to other airline prices. For the value I would consider flying with them again.;The overall flight experience was satisfactory offering a good value for money. The food was good, drink options were adequate. The crew was attentive and courteous. The entertainment choices were limited for English.
Booked Business for my wife and myself from Sydney to Beijing Beijing - Munich Paris - Shanghai and Shanghai - Sydney utilizing the 72 hours Visa free stopover in Beijing and Shanghai. We did the first leg from SYD-PEK. Flight is on Airbus A330-200. Seat is comfortable and it's genuinely a Flatbed 180 degrees with an ample leg space comfortable pillow and quilt. Meals were served hot with a choice of Western and Chinese Dishes. The TV is large with plenty of movies. Cabin Crews were friendly and attentive although some did not speak English well they understood our requests. The Restroom was cleaned and wiped each time a passenger used it. Plane left on- time. On Arrival in Beijing the plane stopped on the Tarmac and a small bus was waiting just for the Business Class Passengers. After the arrival gate 2 ground staff members were holding our names and took our cabin bags and guided us to the Immigration Express Lane then to pick up our luggage. Air China is now our preferred Airline.;We had a wonderful experience with China airlines and we would prefer it over other airlines. The seats, meals, entertainment, cleanliness, and crew service, were all satisfactory.
My flight from JFK New York to Beijing China was 14 hours long. I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of my requested dietary preference was excellent. The meal times also were appreciated because the cabin crew requested all passengers move their seats back to the upright position. I am 6 feet tall and when the seats recline the passenger in front of me ended up crushing my knees. The bathrooms were top notch. On a long flight I expected them to be a disaster but they were always clean. The inflight entertainment was good and kept my kids busy when they were not eating or sleeping. Compared to other long flights I have been on before Air China better than I expected.;The flight experience was fine. the meal timing and the food quality was great. The restrooms were clean and the entertainment was good enough.
DEL-PEK-SFO. After great service at Delhi departure check-in it was downhill for the next 2 flights. None of the cabin crew spoke a word of English or Hindi they were rude and unhelpful. Food was still frozen coffee and tea were not served without a hassle. I booked for convenience of arrival time and it was a mistake. I fly to India once a year and have flown many Asian airlines and they are excellent. When you have 21 hours on a plane you really do expect movie choices more recent than 1960's. I could deal with bad food and no entertainment in a comfortable seat but they should give the ones they have back to the bus they got them from.;The flight experience was awful. The crew behavior was not good. The seat, food, and entertainment, everything was unsatisfactory.
Hong Kong to London Heathrow connecting in Beijing. Multiple schedule changes prior to departure. Flight from Hong Kong to Beijing delayed - no explanation or apology. Flight form Beijing to London delayed by over an hour - no explanation or apology. Cabin crew had little and in some cases no English skills and few if any manners. Wine ran out half way through the meal service and tea and coffee was not offered afterwards. Films in English language consisted mostly of black and white offerings from the 1950s. Checked in luggage did not arrive at Heathrow and it took 3 days for it to be sent to my home. There is nothing good to say about this airline - its the worst national carrier I have ever travelled with.;The worst experience, I ever had. The flights were delayed without apology. The bad manners and communication skills of the crew, lack of drinks, and low quality entertainment selections all added to the bad experience.
Travelled from Sydney Australia to Tokyo Japan planes were new and clean food was excellent airline staff were immaculate and friendly for the budget price we paid you can't go wrong with this airline.;The planes were modern and the service was good enough offering a nice experience.
HKG-PEK flew in Economy and did not expect that there would be inflight entertainment but no headphones distributed. Luckily I had my own set. It was good that the broadcast was in Chinese through the right ear and English through the left. The service was good and the food was adequate.;An overall good experience, with an appropriate service and good food.
CI007 and CI0018 on 4/12 and 4/18. It had been about 6-8 yrs since the last time I went on China Airlines. I was impressed with the improvements made to the entertainment system kept me busy the entire time besides sleeping there are over a hundred movies and my two kids were kept busy. The food has improved a lot. I love the teriyaki chicken rice dish and the porridge was pretty good too. On our way to Hawaii we had a layover in Japan. The only thing I think they need to improve on is the attentiveness of staff on board their uniform is so outdated.;The food and entertainment were the best. The crew service and uniform need improvements.
Flew from London Gatwick to Tokyo via Beijing. My 2 teenagers were a little apprehensive after reading some negative reviews but were pleasantly surprised by the experience. Modern aircraft to Beijing with inflight entertainment and a Boeing 777 to Tokyo with no entertainment console but only a 3 hour flight. All flights left on time and the transfer through Beijing was relatively painless as all flights in same terminal. Meals were very good for airline fodder and plenty of them along with water and drinks. Staff were well turned out and efficient but as pointed out in another review quite emotionless. A couple of smiles wouldn't go amiss! My only gripe was the complexity of the inflight entertainment remote control. Took a bit of working out and couldn't get my daughters to work on the outbound journey. However as travelling in economy goes I would say Air China were one of my better experiences and would be happy to use them again.;A better experience with China airlines. The aircrafts were new with good entertainment choices. The food was fine. The crew was not very friendly.
Beijing - Moscow 2 weeks ago in Y class. The worst flying experience I have had. The aircraft was old and everything was outdated. I have never seen such a dirty plane: tray with dirt ceiling splashed with food and coffee food splashed on side wall floor dirty seat pocket full of debris inside toilet not cleaned sink and out of stock. The food was awful. The worst part of journey were the FAs. They were very rude no smile no English. They did the minimum during the whole flight. Never again.;"A severely poor experience with China airlines; old and grubby plane, terrible food and unattentive crew service."
AKL-SYD A330 full flight so lucky to be given 7B excellent seat. Staff professional friendly and hospitable. Plane was spotless AVOD was inline with most carriers if some what limited in new release films and TV. Food was surprisingly excellent with an Asian and western option. I took the western option beef and potatoes which was delicious. Somewhat small portions though. Drinks were plentiful. For a NZ to SYD option I would definitely recommend this flight.;"Nice experience with China airlines; welcoming crew, tasty meal, adequate drinks, and comfortable seat."
I booked a return trip from London to Manila via Beijing due to the flight price and we had a stopover for 2 days in Beijing. Having read some comments I was not expecting the most comfortable flight. However I was pleasantly surprised. All our flights were on time and the planes were clean and the seats were comfortable. The inflight entertainment was ok on the London - Beijing route as there was a good selection of films / programmes. The only negative points of our flights were the boarding of the plane at Heathrow which could have been organised better and the quality of some of the food could be improved. The staff could have also provided more drinks for a long flight. However overall this was a good value for money experience.;The flight was pleasant in a clean and comfortable plane with good food, entertainment, and timely arrival and departure.
I was a bit hesitant due to mixed reviews of this airline . I traveled from Sydney to Beijing return and was very happy with the airline. There seemed to be great leg room and the food was really good especially comparing it to the food I ate while in China which was a very low standard much to my disappointment. There was a good choice on the inflight entertainment but don't travel at night as the Chinese nationals on this flight kept up the talking and noise through out the wee hours of the morning making sleep impossible something I have not found travelling to other countries. They sprayed the flight on the way back into Sydney with some sort of insect spray which is something I have not encountered before but maybe this happens on all airlines from China? It would be a problem if you were sensitive to chemicals.;A good flight with comfortable seating, good food and flight entertainment system.
LAX-TPE-MNL return. LAX-TPE 747 seats so small in width it made a long trip horrible and I'm an average size man. Felt like my hips were in a vice grip. TPE-MNL A330 seats a lot better. MNL-TPE A340 seats fine again. Everything else ok. Good value considering.;An average experience with China airlines.
Business class from PEK to BKK was a solid flight but I'd suggest eating before you board. The food had an odd aroma as did the damp hand towels that were kindly offered before the meal. The champagne was okay although it was served in a thimble sized glass the fruit was sweet and the rice was positively offensive. How can rice be bad? Not too sure what was wrong with it but it wasn't edible. The flight attendants were observant and wanting to please but everything was done without any smiles. Perhaps that's a cultural thing. Bathrooms were spotless as was the plane. The seats were super comfortable perhaps more comfortable than United Global First seats apart from the slightly restricted foot space. It was interesting that they didn't offer seat back monitors but they did offer individual iPads. The lounge was comfortable and offered limited food selections. Apart from the dismal food and the lack of entertainment Air China provides a very good product.;The food was not very good and the seat back entertainment system was lacking. Everything else was fine and comfortable providing a good value for money.
Moscow-PEK-HKG in business class. First time on CA biz class. Was a bit hesitant due to very different reviews here. Have to say that I was pleasantly surprised about the whole experience. New biz product is great. One of the most comfortable biz seats ever experienced. comfortable in any sleeping position. Some airlines compromise in terms of width or length of seat not CA. Only negative is the lack of a screen on Moscow-PEK route. CA provides tablet but unfortunately mostly Asian/Chinese movies. Food is decent so is service - friendly but not overly attentive. Would definitely fly them again if price is competitive.;A wonderful and comfortable flight experience. The entertainment options on the provided tablets were very limited and the back seat screens were missing.
I flew YVR-PEK-MNL and return in March 2014. The airline was better than I expected. The check-in was excellent in Vancouver and Manila fast and efficient. All aircraft's left and arrived on time. The food was good but not excellent. Cabin service was okay the only downside was the staff never smiled. The entertainment was also good. All in all when the low price of the trip is considered the trip was good. I would recommend Air China.;The check-in was swift, the food and service were average, flight entertainment was fine. I would recommend flying with China airlines.
Just returned March 11 from Beijing to New York. The plane was brand new and although it was a 14 hour flight my husband (6 ft 2) and I were very comfortable. Flight attendants were friendly and if one didn't know English very well they would find another attendant to help. Lots of food wine and beer served then during the night it was self serve for cold drinks and snacks. Few lineups for the bathroom. Smooth flight from New York to Beijing then we flew 5 days later to Shanghai. Returned to Beijing airport 3 days later and flew back to New York JFK. Beijing airport is huge but we had no problem getting around and checking in for all flights. Great value for the money.;A very long but comfortable flight. The crew was friendly and helpful. The food and beverage options were adequate. A good product experience.
Recently flew LHR-PEK-HKG and return. Transfers at Beijing were a joke worst organisation I have ever seen with many people missing their connections. Knowing the tight schedule luggage was not loaded onto the LHR flight meaning people like me who pushed to the front of the queue had no luggage on arrival. Staff at Beijing were rude uncooperative and didn't seem to care about the situation.;A lot of problems encountered during transfer at Beijing. The staff were not courteous and cooperative to deal with the situation.
"LHR-PEK Boeing 777. All in all a superb flight starting with access to the Singapore Airlines First Class lounge at Heathrow. On board the cabin was immaculate and the suites in First very private; the flight attendant was attentive and while there was some small language issues she was extremely accommodating and ensured a fine trip. The food was good but not great the wines fine and there was a good selection of movies on the IFE system. All in all a product that I highly recommend and will happily travel with Air China in the future.";The flight experience was fabulous. The crew was helpful and supportive. The food was averge and entertainment was good. I would recommend China airlines.
Feb 10 return on 28th. CA986 and CA179 for the flights out and CA180 and CA985 for the return. Held in the plane on the tarmac for 5 hours while repairs were made. Old plane still had ash trays. Customer service was horrible but that could be a cultural issue. Multiple complications arrived late in China missed connecting flight to the Philippines. Coming back was a little better with a nicer plane and a little better customer service. Still had complications on the return flight and issues still unresolved by Air China. Overall in price I saved $200 per ticket but I would rather pay $200 more and avoid all the misfortunes of this journey with using Air China.;The were a lot of troubles during the journey. The plane was old, had problems, delayed flight, and then missed the connecting flight. I would choose to fly with other airlines in future.
TPE-Koror return in business. Both flights on time. Plane packed both ways. Service was fine. I wish they would ditch serving the main course of a business-class meal in what looks like a coffee filter. Planes didn't have AVOD. Return flight showed a film about the Nazis (not exactly the most cheery thing to see coming back from vacation) and the menu offered a German sausage dish-simply bizarre. There is no lounge in Koror-they give you a coupon for a drink and some potato chips at a broom-closet-sized bar.;The flights were on time and the plane was full. The food and entertainment were average.
Delta flight from ATL arrived late in LAX so I missed a flight to Narita. Agent booked me on a China Airlines flight to Taipei and then a follow on flight to BKK. The aircraft appeared to be brand new inside and everything worked well. The entertainment package was up to date and varied. The cabin crew were very attentive throughout the long flight. I especially liked the reverse boarding for economy class as it went quicker with less standing around waiting for people to hide their carry on baggage. The landings were absolute the smoothest I have ever experienced.;A great experience in a new aircraft with updated enetrtainment system, good service, and smooth landing.
I flew from Stockholm Arlanda to Wuhan China with a transit in Beijing. It was an 8 hour flight from Stockholm to Beijing. The flight crew had a rather bad manner towards economy class customers the crew was impatient spoke terrible English and speak Chinese directly to customers. They don't serve wine until it's time to eat. I was sitting only two rows away from a couple who brought their two young kids one of which cried for over 4 hours during the flight. Not single staff member showed up to comfort the baby. Air china lost my luggage in Beijing while I made it to Wuhan. I have to fly again to another city in two days without luggage I guess.;A troublesome flight with non-courteous crew. My luggage was lost in Beijing.
I flew from PEK to LAX in Business class on the newer aircraft and seat was basically lie flat. No issues with that flight. Check-in time was much nicer at 7pm since not at 7am or earlier like USA based airlines. On the way back I was from SFO to PEK on an older 747 but I asked for row 83 at the gate (they block it since it is an exit row) and I got it. I still love the peace and quiet afforded to the upstairs passenger by the 747. This is since the economy and crying babies are one level lower. Only a few passengers up there so I had a flight attendant pretty much to myself. Got all the drinks I desired and a double meal of the Salmon. It was so flavorful. The entertainment system truly needs to be like Cathay Pacific as right now it is just not enough movies that are in English and newer. The best part is they did a few announcements at the beginning of the flight and then remained quiet for the rest pretty much. I wish the entertainment system had an ability to not break-off for PA in a language that was not your own. Overall I would say Air china ok for business class. My next trip might be in their Economy and I bet I will not be as happy.;The business class flight experience was good with China airlines. The check-in process, food, peaceful environment, and crew service were all fine. The entertainment system was lacking in recent English movies collection.
"New York to PEK to Chengdu. Plane was clean and attendants were all friendly and polite. I found the food surprisingly good for ""airline food"". While I was in the economy class I never felt like my needs were unimportant. Some attendants did not speak English well. But they certainly did their best and always smiled and figured out what I was asking or needed and I must say their English is far better than my ""Chinese"". Good job Air China I hope to fly with you again.";The aircraft was neat and tidy, meal was tasty, and crew was nice. I hope for another flight with China airlines.
Frankfurt-Beijing-Singapore and back. Flights on time and relatively cheap. No hello and no goodbye no thank you and no please from the crew. I asked for a glass of wine but was told that they only open the bottle with the food. My neighbor wanted a third glass of wine and was told he had enough. No spirits in economy. I eat just about anything and I have never really had reason to complain about airline food before but just the smell of the food was awful. Food was bland and servings were small. They had drinks like juice in the kitchen for passengers to help themselves. Our 4 year old daughter didn't get any special attention. The cabin crew didn't smile and it felt like you are a burden to them. Inflight Entertainment had a small choice of bad movies. On one leg there were problems with the sound. Annoying announcements throughout the flight. The seatbelt sign was switched on throughout all flights.;The flights were timely and economical. The cabin crew were neither friendly, not courteous. The food was not good at all and the serving size was very small. The entertainment system was problematic and lacking selection.
Flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 2 January 2014. Really clean and nice aircraft. The Airbus 321 looked dirty but smelt like it came straight from the factory. The crew on this flight were excellent! They spoke English really well and were very friendly and service minded. As for the seats they were like any other standard economy seat but with great legroom. For lunch they served chicken or beef. I had the chicken which was good. Not the best food but it was okay for the 3.5 hr flight. We took of on time and landed on time despite leaving Hong Kong during the morning rush hour. I highly recommend Air China!;The aircraft was nice and tidy. the flights were on time. the crew service and their English communication skills were great. the seats were comfy and the food was average.
They changed my flight schedule more than 5 times prior to the flight date. After my initial outbound flight from London Heathrow I wasn't too upset. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and the fact that I had in-flight entertainment for both the 9-hour and 4-hour flights. However on the inbound flight back to London I was extremely disappointed with the fact that there wasn't any in-flight entertainment after being pleasantly surprised during the outbound. The connecting flight was scheduled much too early and the logistics in Beijing Airport meant that we had to be specifically rushed through. I was initially worried that my luggage would not be able to make the transfer but after the hour's delay I was hopeful! In the end my luggage got left in Beijing and after arriving on a Friday my luggage got to me on Sunday. Overall the seats were alright but not quite right either - other airlines like Qatar are better. The food was not bad but the drinks did not have enough variety. The hospitality was very good actually which was a surprise to everyone who asked!;There was change of flight schedule five times before actual date. The outbound flights were quite pleasant while the inbound flight was too early and had no entertainment system. There were problems with the luggage. The food and hospitality was fine.
Sydney to Shanghai return overall it's worth the money (relatively cheaper than others) food is edible plane is quite new toilets clean throughout the flight and seats are wide enough for average height passengers. Only concern is the staff service I did not see anyone smile throughout the entire flight.;The flight experience was worth the money spent. Food, clenliness, seat comfort were all good. The crew service was missing a smile.
Vancouver to Beijing really needed to upgrade their cabin entertainment systems. The controls were dirty and buttons was unresponsive. Their food was awful. All of my baggage was delayed during the round trip. Never flying Air China again.;The experience was terrible with the old entertainment system having dirty and barely functioning controls, tasteless food, and baggage delay.
We travelled from UK to Australia via Beijing and visa versa. Staff were quite stand offish and didn't speak English very well a smile would have been nice. 2 meals supplied were very poor and no English option available. Meals were very basic and no snacks offered. Drinks only offered during meals and they only came round a few times with water. Entertainment was poor very dated films. Beijing airport: staff had no idea what they were doing and caused complete chaos amongst passengers. We passed through baggage control which took 2 hrs only to walk down 24 steps to go through the same thing again. Then transferred onto plane to Australia and service was exactly the same. Return was the same treatment it was -9 in Beijing and hence it was also -9 in the airport the air- conditioning was full blast. The flight to the UK was slightly better only because the staff spoke a little more English. We had to close the blinds even though it was a daytime flight. All in all our Air China experience was not a good one.;The overall experience was not good. The cabin service was niether courteous not friendly. Their English communication skills were very bad. Meals were only basic, the snack and drinks were lacking and the entertainment was outdated.
Travelled Air China as it was the cheapest at the time flight on time and no delays first leg of journey on A340 not too bad and food reasonable but second leg Shanghai to Sydney plane was old food inedible and cold. No drinks provided other than with meals air hostesses command of English poor. On the way back food was awful on both legs full of very badly behaved children asked for an alcoholic drink and was told could only have one with dinner entertainment system antiquated no really up to date movies too many Chinese ones and very temperamental system. Would be worth paying extra for a better trip as on a long haul flight its needed.;It is worth choosing another airline for a long haul flight. The flights were on time. The first leg of the journey went fine while the second leg experience was not good. The food was poor, drinks were lacking, english communication was a problem and the entertainment quite dated.
China Airlines uses old- seats (no flat-bed) flights for European-Asian routes. Compare with other airlines seats offered such as Eva air Korean Air Cathay Pacific Air France Japan Airlines are much better CI flights really need serious improvement. The seat in front of you can recline on you. This makes the whole journey very uncomfortable: difficult to work and difficult to get out of your seat. Food is good but the service is very slow. You don't receive hot towels in the morning and no hot drinks were offered while breakfast being served. Lounges at Taipei and Bangkok airports are not very clean. The receptionists are friendly enough but the lounges are not exactly business-friendly. If you have connection flights luggage cannot be guaranteed on arrival. Even when travelling on Business Class no compensation is offered for late arrival of luggage. Flight attendants are generally friendly. Entertainment channels are inadequate and the TV screen is very out-dated.;China airline offers uncomfortable seats, and slow service. Amenities like hot towels were missing, lounges were also not clean. Although the food was good, no hot drinks were served during breakfast. Problems with luggage are quite possible.
I have flown Air China Business class for many years. I have always found the staff more than courteous and helpful. On seating was handed a juice/wine and hot towel. This is a night flight. No problem getting coffee/tea at any time. Eat western food and is generally ok. Could do with some improvement. Staff always coming back to see if you need more coffee/tea. Inflight entertainment fair. Seats fold to straight bed and very comfortable. Got a good nights sleep. Staff very helpful in morning with coffee before breakfast.;The business class experience was wonderful. The friendly and helpful crew, good hospitality, nice food, fine entertainment, and comfortable seats all add up to a very positive experience.
Shanghai-Frankfurt Jan 13th. Plane left on time. Flight attendant kind and helpful. Got an aisle seat in the first row of the cabin and had plenty of space for my legs. That were the good points. English announcements spoken with an incomprehensible beginner's accent. Movie choice again very violence dominated mostly Chinese audio quality very low. Food was a shame in comparison to even average Chinese cuisine. Though it was a day time flight blinds had to be closed all day. Got a headache having to read all day by means of the dim seat lighting. Worst was the cabin temperature (my watch showed between 16° and 18°). Almost everybody put on his/her coat which sadly did not prevent from the AC which streamed constantly down to the aisle seats. Entered the plane in a sound condition left it with heavy sinus irritations. This decreases the value for money very much. I would not recommend.;The overall experience was not very good. Although the seating was quite comfortable and the flight attendants were nice, english communication, entertainment options, food, and cabin temperature were poor. I would not recommend to others.
Frankfurt-Shanghai Economy. Had got a window seat by online check in. Flight started dead on time plane was very clean seats comfortable (A330). As the movie choice was mainly violence-bound and absurdly censored/cut I resigned on spoiling my eyes on those low-quality monitors and slept through most of the flight. Food was quite okay service efficient and kind. In comparison to the price this was a rather good value for money rate.;The flight was timely and the environment was clean and comfortable. The entertainment options were not very reasonable. However, the food was fine and the service was swift.
My first time using CI. My trip was CGK-TPE-LAX-TPE-CGK. TPE-LAX plane was an old 747 which is still un- refurbished among others. The seats were not as comfortable as the refurbished ones and the AVOD screen was so small! LAX-TPE plane was the refurbished one. The seats were comfortable enough for long haul flights and the AVOD screen was the new one. CGK-TPE and TPE-CGK planes were comfortable to me and the stewardesses English fluency was good even though I still kept asking for something in Mandarin. The food was awful to me compared to another Asian carriers. The movies and music selections on Fantasy Sky were not as much as the others. I'd say CI is NOT uncomfortable for long-haul flights and didn't worth it enough for me.;The experience on one leg of the journey was not good while the other one was fine. On the first leg, the aircraft was old and the seats were not very comfortable. The second leg was on a refurbished plane. The entertainment options were limited. 
YVR-TPE-DEL return. First time travelling with China Airlines and it turned out to be a fairly good experience. 747-400 between YVR and TPE seemed newer but A 330's between TPE-DEL seemed older. IFE was fine and toilets were kept clean and cabin crew was polite and spoke fairly good English. We had a delay at YVR which was not really airlines' fault because the bridge could not be retracted. Apart from that all other three take offs were also slightly late. My only real complaint would be the beverages and food. They seem to be very limited in what they offer. Still I would certainly recommend it.;A reasonably good experience. The plane was fine with a good inflight entertainment, clean toilets and good crew service. The flights were a bit delayed. The food and drink options were very limited.
Taipei to Honolulu via Tokyo in economy. All flights on time. Food OK. Plane and bathrooms clean. Entertainment not bad. Service was great at all levels. Would fly them again for this route.;timely flights, good food and entertainment, clean environment, fine service, all add up to a wonderful expe+D275rience.
CI53 from BNE to AKL continuation of flight from TPE. The aircraft upgraded to a B747-400 from usual A330-300 in Dec. Check in swift. Gate agents a bit rude. Managed to grab a seat on upper deck. Usually J class but sold as Y on BNE-AKL leg. Flight was on time. Arrived a few minutes early in to AKL. Food was reasonably good. Good AVOD entertainment. Fantastic flight attendants who were very polite and kind. Did two tea coffee runs. Excellent option to NZOFVA or JQ on route. Managed to get a good fare and would consider in future too.;The overall experience was fine. The check-in process was smooth, there was no delay, food was nice, and the crew was very courteous. I would consider flying with them again.
PVG-TPE B747 Short flight. comfortable seating given distance but would be concerned if this was the room allowed on a long flight (747). Despite short flight full meal served with coffee/tea. Inflight entertainment available but did not partake.;The experience was good for a short flight with comfortable seating and a full meal.
London Heathrow to Hong Kong via Beijing one month round trip. Flights left pretty much on time nice planes with good food and great entertainment on the long haul LHR to PEK flight - individual entertainment systems. Aircraft were modern. Wide range of refreshments including Chinese beer and wine on both connecting flights. Small issue with return ticket (as PEK - LGW service had been stopped after I purchased) was easily rectified at Hong Kong check in - desk staff spoke good enough English. Point to note: confirm any schedule changes that are sent to you by phone for ease of mind.;The experience was good on modern planes, tasty food and snacks, and great flight entertainment system. A bit of issue occurred with the return ticket but was fixed.
LAX to Beijing to Hong Kong and back to LAX. The staff is mean to you if you are a westerner. The food is terrible - it reminds me of the food you would get on airlines in the 1990s. With every meal they would give you a tea cup but not offer you any tea so the cup just gets in the way while you are eating. The inflight entertainment is very poor some of them don't work at all and sometimes you don't even get any. The staff English skills are lacking terribly to the point that they might as well just speak to you in Chinese. I cannot stress enough how mean they are they are to westerners.;The cabin staff seem quite mean to the western passengers. The english communication skill was too bad. The food is not good at all and the entertainment system is barely functioning.
Flew from London Heathrow to Beijing on a weekend late afternoon flight. Wasn't particularly looking forward to it given some of the other reviews but the plane was fairly new and clean the in-flight entertainment system was fine (on demand personal seat selection with plenty of choice in English). The food was reasonable enough and the customer service at check-in and prior to that when I rang up to request seats together for three of us was good. Bit of an attempted scrum on to the slightly delayed plane but all-in-all this was much better than I had expected and up to the standard of other Star Alliance members. I'd still prefer to travel with British Airways and would pay more to do so but to be honest Air China weren't far away in terms of what they offer (though a bit more wine wouldn't go amiss).;The experience was fine. The aircraft was fairly new and tidy, the entertainment system was good, food was ok and the service was reasonable. Only that the flight was somewhat delayed.
My major complaint about this airline is that they allow only 15 pounds in tourist for carry on luggage that is 5-10 pounds less than most international airlines so for that reason I will not fly this airline again and I regret booking the flight. You will notice that I rated the airline very high on their seats food and overall service but I have found that with a limit of 20-25 pounds I can easily go on tour with a hand carry - but the 25 pound limit would make it impossible to do any shopping while on tour. Yes their prices are attractive and I believe their policy is short-sighted.;The service and pricing is reasonable but the allowed luggage size is not enough.
Surprisingly pleased with the flights with China Airlines. SYD to KIX via TPI then TPI to SYD on A330-300. New aircraft allocated on all legs good food great service and AVOD in line with all the five star airlines. Would recommend.;A pleasing experience on a new aircraft, good food, service and entertainment.
SFO-Beijing-BKK flight in June 2013 and the service was mediocre. An old aircraft with 60-70 people sharing one big TV monitor. When we first got onboard it was very hot in the cabin the stewardess said its normal and once we were flying the temperature would cool down. The flight was late so I missed my connecting flight. I was placed into an airport hotel. On the last flight coming home there was water dropping from the overhead bin so the stewardess put tissues and napkins in between the gaps.;The aircraft was old, service was just average, temperature was not good. The flight was delayed that caused me missing the connecting flight.
TPE-ICN. flown with them as a codeshare flight with Korean air. The plane (747) was very old (or at least seemed like that). Surprisingly the seat was very comfortable more than in most of the new planes I've flown with. The entertainment system isn't too varied but well enough for a short flight. The crew were professional. Overall liked the product.;The overall experience was good. Although the aircraft was old, the seating, service,  and entertainment were still good enough for a shorthaul flight.
I flew on 2 international and 3 domestic flights with Air China. Overall the experience was stressful and frustrating. My booking allowed for changes to my flights but the staff I communicated with about this were unhelpful and slow. All except one of the flights departed late (between 15 minutes and 5 hours) without clear communication as to the reason for the delays and how long the flights would be delayed. It took an hour to check in for one flight due to the staff being disorganised and once I boarded that flight I found that my seat had been changed without checking with me first. The food was average. Usually I really enjoy flying and am happy with what I pay for. Air China didn't deliver and was terrible value for money.;The experience with China airlines was exhausting and annoying. Most of the flights were delayed and the staff was not supportive. The food was just average.
Flight 982 departed JFK late causing missed connection in Beijing to Air China Flight 979. Air China staff in Beijing were very rude. No apology for the missed connection and they sent passengers to a dreadful airport hotel and would only pay for shared rooms. If I wanted a single room I would have to pay for it myself which I did. Air China is a member of Star Alliance and I expected them to re-book on the first available flight which would have left at 6am the next morning but they would only rebook on the next Air China flight which did not depart until the next afternoon. I arrived at my destination almost 24 hours late and paid for lodging and food in Beijing out of my pocket.;The flight was delayed that resulted in missing the connecting flight. The staff were discourteous and impolite. They arranged for an airport hotel with shared rooms for passengers that was very uncomfortable.
Tokyo-Shanghai-Paris and Paris-Beijing-Tokyo. Trusted this airline because it is a Star Alliance member. International transfer at Shanghai was terrible. You have to immigrate and emigrate wasting a lot of time. Cabin crews were cheerful and trying to help passengers. Shanghai-to-Paris old A330 overall shabby but seat was not bad with full-flat and wide leg space. Paris-to-Beijing new 777-300ER clean and new aircraft full-flat bed but leg space was very narrow (not shot). Food was OK. Finally they lost my bag even though intra-airline connection.;The transfer process at Shanghai airport was troublesome and time consuming. The seats were comfortable and the crew was helpful. The food was average. The bad part is that I lost my baggage.
JFK-PEK and SHA-PEK-JFK on return leg. JFK-PEK-JFK flights were on a new B777-300ER. Full flat seats in an angled 2-2-2 configuration. Very comfortable seats for sitting and sleeping. Good food and drinks with a full bar and helpful FA's who sometimes struggled with English but could get by. Large IFE screen with AVOD although I wish they had a wider selection of English titles. Both flights were delayed by about half an hour. SHA-PEK was bang on time and was on a 777-200 which surprisingly had identical seats to the B777-300ER ie full flat - very nice for a 2-hour domestic flight. Very comfortable and they served a lavish hot breakfast on take-off. Baggage delivery was flawless. Overall very good experience and would recommend but the lounges at both PEK and SHA need to be upgraded.;The experience was quite satisfactory. The comfortable seating, good food and beverage choices, nice crew and service, great entertainment selection, baggage delivery, everything was a plus.
SYD-PEK-SYD economy on an A330-200. Plane was clean comfortable good seat pitch good pillow and blanket. Flights left and arrived on time. Service was efficient with limited communication in English but friendly and pleasant. IFE was back of seat films a little dated but nothing offensive or vulgar so great for a family and easy to watch. Dinner was plentiful but average tasting and breakfast if European go English. Same on the return average but plentiful. Drinks are warm but that's everywhere in China not just in the air. Bathrooms clean but can get dirty quickly and queuing is not always respected. Flight was full so strict on luggage weight and allowance but the allowance is more than most airlines anyway over head lockers where plentiful and hardly used. I rang Air China and selected my seat in advance free over the phone and entered my FF details very helpful and good English. For a cheap carrier better than most direct flight on certain days SYD-PEK-SYD.;The overall experience was fine. The aircraft was tidy with comfy seats. The flights were on time. The entertainment, food, and baggage allowance were fine. The staff was quite helpful and had good english communication.
Milan-Beijing delayed about 3 hours so I lost the transfer to Sydney. I asked for assistance but the service was totally inadequate. They give me for the night an awful hotel (Golden Phoenix) in Beijing they had no accessible bus-shuttle and didn't seem to care about it everybody was unkind. Inflight the crew did not speak good english and unprofessional the entertainment did not work for a long time.;The flight was delayed that caused missed connecting flight. The arrangements made by the airline was completely unsatisfactory. The staff was careless and unpolished.
Houston-Beijing-Bangkok. Food quality inconsistent and for the most part poor. Service poor and some flight attendants rude can't have your phone on even in plane mode and staff is not bilingual. If you have a medical problem they try to ignore you. I had an asthma attack and had to beg for oxygen which they were initially reluctant to give me.;The crew and service quality was substandard. I had an asthma attack and they were still careless and unwilling to help.
Shanghai Pudong-Taipei Taoyuan return on B747-400 excellent experience with CI arrival/departure on time only 1.5 hrs flight but got full meal and beverage service. AVOD with touch screen and lots movies cabin crew very friendly. Definitely will fly with CI again.;A fantastic experience with China airlines on a short flight with full meal, great service and great entertainment.
Hong Kong-Taichung on 737-800 and Taipei-Hong Kong on 747-400. Outbound flight to Taichung in central Taiwen which is very convenient for those who need to go to this area instead of flying to Taipei or Kaoshiung. Evening flight of 1.15hr duration warm meal was served beverages only tea and coffee though. Crew did not smile just did their job. Aircraft spotlessly clean. Return flight on 747-400 same flight duration also warm meal served this time with wine/beer/soft drinks. Very attentive FAs who interacted well with the passengers and smiled a lot. Lots of information from the flight deck too. Overall a very nice experience where else do you get a warm meal on such a short flight in Economy. Definitely recommendable and looking forward to using them again.;Great experience with china airlines. Good and warm food, friendly, active and smiling staff, and clean environment everything was fantastic.
Took CI752 SIN-TPE-SIN and CI751. Punctuality was superb. As for on-board experience the A332 was rather comfortable with sufficient leg room for a 170cm person. The flight attendants some were not as friendly but there were those who made sure to smile as much as possible. The Personal IFE was average nothing special. My only problem with it was lack of movies. The food was okay. However we were not well-hydrated. FAs performed only 2-3 water rounds I had to keep asking for water. I liked how they gave some Taiwanese snack. The landing was quite smooth. Return journey delayed by 30 mins due to TPE jammed runway. More or less the same.;The seating was comfortable, the food and ebtertainment was just average, movie collection was still limited, service was fine, and the return flight was somewhat delayed.
Spring break vacation. CI 31 YVR-TPE. The service in Economy was horrible some flight attendants didn't know what I was saying and the seat was extremely uncomfortable for a 13 hour flight. Legroom was only 31 inches I would expect 34 inches of legroom and a foot rest at least on a long flight like this. Inflight Entertainment on my seat was very bad it did not work seconds after takeoff. The seat was hard. The food was okay but I believe giving us paper cups for non alcoholic drinks and plastic cups for alcoholic drinks is wrong. Putting the A340-300 on the YVR route is not a great idea!;The service experience was awful, seat was not comfortable, and the entertainment system did not work.
Taipei to Brisbane in business class on CI 53 11 May. A330-300 very comfortable lie flat seats and a nice Doona made for a restful night. Staff very attentive and meals and refreshments were offered at appropriate times. Would recommend for the good price and comfortable cabin. The entertainment was interesting and up to date and restrooms kept clean and well stocked.;The plane was clean and comfortable. The staff was quite active and served the meals and beverages well. The enetrtainment was updated and the restrooms were well maintained. 
"TPE-MNL. Flight delayed by 25 minutes arrival time also delayed. No drinks except for water coffee or tea. When I went to the restroom I saw that there were other refreshments in the galley. The flight wasn't full and I took a chance if I would be served an extra meal. The crew said that she would check and came back with 3 packs of peanuts. It seems that seeing the crew with a smile is a ""luxury"". Not surprising why Eva Air has better reviews.";The flight was not on time. The snacks and drinks were lacking and the crew has not a smile on face.
AMS to BKK about 6 to 7 times per year Lounges both ways quite good. Recently refurbished (last 12 months) the 747's which were good but now have reverted to the A340 and seats definitely far poorer. Please change back! Also the flight time has increased dramatically due to fuel saving flying at much lower speeds.;The lonuges were nice but the planes have been returned back to the old ones with uncomfortable seats and long flight timing.
AMS-BKK. Seating 3x4x2 flight 90% Full. The one big problem was that the meals were only just warm not hot as they should have been. Crew carried out their duties well. Would fly them again.;The meals were just warm but could be better if hot. The service quality was good.
Flew business class XMN-TPE-SFO and return LAX-TPE-XMN. Impressed by the refurbished cabin. The new seats are comfortable but are not lie-flat. Inflight meals are good but you can feel the catering quality outbound is better than inbound. The new LCD screen is higher definition one which makes inflight entertainment better.;The cabin is upgraded and the seats are quite comfortable, meals were fine, and the entertainment system was great.
NRT-TPE return. Check-in was smooth (SkyPriority). Lounges were comfortable. But foods at NRT were poor. Cabin (744 and 333) were clean and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and spoke Japanese. Foods were good. AVOD was good. But no Japanese movie. Good value for money.;A good value for money with good lounges, cozy and tidy cabin, fine food, good entertainment and friendly crew.
Flight from Hong Kong - Jakarta - Hong Kong with China Airlines CI679/CI680 in Economy class. Check in staff friendly and fast. I'm a Skyteam Elite Plus Member and used the lounges. Nice clean and helpful staff. Food and beverages good. No Priority Boarding at HKG Airport. Seat uncomfortable in A330. Food ok. Inflight Entertainment good. All Flights on time. Priority luggage in Hong Kong handled separately but ended up waiting longer. Would fly again.;The check-in was swift, the lounges were tidy and comfortable with good food and beverage options, the flight entertainment was also good. There was no priority boarding.
Have flown China Airlines about 3 times now from Auckland to Brisbane and Sydney. Paid no more than $120 for my tickets (one way special). Ticket allowed free date changes which was a bonus! Normally pay $100 with other Trans Tasman Airlines. Friendly Cabin Crew. Great meals (not to mention complimentary beverages). Half the flight was empty of 2 services I flew which gave me rows to myself made it extremely comfortable to fly. Great entertainment system. Highly recommend out of NZ or Australia.;A recommendable value for money with free date changes on ticket, friendly staff, nice meals, comfy seating, and fine entertainment.
Round trip MNL-YVR via stopover at TPE. They seem to have done a major overhaul of their operating procedures and got their act together consistently for several years now. Their aircraft appeared to be in good to excellent condition and to the credit of the pilots involved those four landings were among the smoothest I've experienced in years. This airline may not be the best but I consider them to be very good. Fares are reasonable and given the level of service I received was good value for money.;Good quality of service and low fares make this flight a good value for money.
Flew from Brisbane-Taipei-Wuhan and then Xi'an Xianyang-Taipei-Brisbane. Overall impression was highly favourable and an improvement on my previous experiences with CI. All flights were on A330-300 which is starting to look a little aged in economy class. Flights were on time or only slightly delayed and boarding was efficient. Meals were of a very high standard in economy and the mainly female cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I noticed that the fluency of English (though I understand Mandarin) has improved significantly. Inflight entertainment was personal AVOD but selection was not quite as large compared to Cathay or Qantas. Flight from TPE to BNE was on an A330 with upgraded economy cabin. The screens were larger and seat more comfortable so this was a nice improvement. Based on these flights I will fly with CI again and have no hesitation recommending.;The overall experience was appreciating. The boarding process was without any trouble, no or little delay in flights, meals were high quality, crew service, communication, and entertainment was all good. Only issue was the availability of limited selection of inflight entertainment.
Flew LAX-TPE-BKK and returned HAN-TPE-LAX. All flights left and arrived roughly on time. Staff were somewhat inattentive but got the job done. Had to signal an attendant to get a second glass of wine. Seat comfort OK for economy class. In-flight entertainment was very good.;The experience was quite satisfactory with on-time flights, comfortable seating, good service and entertainment.
Overall as good as any other Asian carrier friendly staff food was fine plenty of movies etc. Standard A330-300 Auckland to Brisbane. Would use again.;A recommenndable experience with a fine service, food, and entertainment collection.
Jakarta-Taipei-Los Angeles-Taipei-Jakarta. Very comfortable seat ground staff and cabin crew were very helpful and friendly and the in flight entertainment was great.;The comfortable seating, helpful staff, and good entertainment all contribute to a pleasant experience.
AMS to BKK business class CI0066: 2 adults and one 3 year old brilliant service apart from a couple of hours delay from AMS which was down to snow not the airline - had a faultless service. Cabin staff were excellent with my daughter and this trip was stress free. I will be using this airline again shortly.;An excellent service experience. I would fly with them in future.
Taipei-Hong Kong Economy. Very uncomfortable seat with virtually no leg room. Luckily seat next to me was free and was able to stretch my legs in to that space. Breakfast was a greyish-looking chicken noodle dish that was unappetising. Cabin staff raced through the service and then disappeared. They were mechanical and their smiles were plastic. Thankfully the flight was short (90 min).;The seating was very uncomfortable, food was not good, and crew were not friendly.
Amsterdam to Bangkok. The business class has been refurbished on this route but is not a flat bed seat - good seat pitch. The food and drinks were very good though the staff only ok. Moderate selection of films. Amsterdam bKLM lounge is huge with ok selection of snacks. Bangkok business lounge is surprisingly good with really good food though it doesn't have a toilet - you have to go down the corridor.;The staff service was just average but the seating and meals were good. The movie selection was a bit limited. Amsterdam and Bangkok lounges were fine.
"Osaka to JFK. The flight was 14 hours B747-400 I sat in a window seat just behind the wing. AVOD had new movies and a big variety of other entertainment. A big plus was that the AVOD selection was different coming home. The food was enjoyable and service was plentiful and well organized. The cabin crew were very pleasant and attentive. I am average size; 5'10"" and 180 lbs and I had no need for more space. The recline and leg room were generous for economy. I usually fly Korean Air Asiana or Singapore for this route but since China Airlines was so much cheaper I thought I would give them a try once. If they are this cheap in the future I will fly with them again.";The overall experience was good. The meals were tasty, cabin crew were attentive and friendly, the seat was comfortable even in the economy, and the entertainment selection was great.
TPE to LAX. The seats are so close that when the person in front of me reclined I could not exit my seat or watch the seatback TV. It seems that over the past 2 years the service food and overall quality of flights has diminished. Our company no longer allows us to book our Asian rides on China Airlines and frankly I am glad. We pay 75 dollars more for flights on Singapore air and the difference is 10 fold.;The seating was quite uncomfortable and the overall service and food quality has declined over the previous years.
LAX-TPE-HKG return with stopover in Taipei. The ground and flight staff were professional friendly and helpful. The airplanes looked new and well kept. The seats in the economy sections were new but the cushion was thin and soft causing severe discomfort on long flights. Complete meals served even on short flights the food was mainly edible but poor compared to other Asian airlines. I would have rated this an excellent airline if the seat cushion and food quality were better.;The aircraft was new and well-maintained, and the crew were pleasant and supportive. But the seat comfort and food quality needs quite improvement.
Flying to Guam on board their A330 punctuality of the flight very good and the pre-flight service nice. Cabin crew are all friendly and smile throughout. Personal entertainment includes some great films and games but the meal service is nothing special. Would fly again.;Except the food and beverage section, the experience was fine with the service, timing, and entertainment.
To and from Singapore and Surabaya economy class both on A330-300. Flights were all on time and return flight arrived ahead of schedule. Flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. Entertainment system was great. I was pleased we had access to the entertainment system even though the flight was only 2 hours. Cabins and the toilets were clean. Food was just so-so but the taste was overall acceptable.;The experience was fine with timely flights, good service, average food, and good entertainment.
Awful experience from Taipei to LA. My husband is 6ft 4 and when we checked in early in the morning for our flights from Bangkok to Taipei and Taipei to LA we asked the ticket agent to sit us in seats that would accommodate his height. Told we'll have plenty of room. When we got onboard we were instead seated in the tightest seats next to the lavatory. When my husband couldn't sit down there was much flurry of activity to find him somewhere he could fit. He was embarrassed and naturally we were separated from him for the entire trip - no apology from anyone of course. Ironically people who checked in after us were seated in a front row with leg room. As usual much pushing and shoving onboard with no order imposed by the cabin crew. If flight attendants spent more time taking care of their customers they may have a few more happy customers.;The crew service had a careless attitude in arranging seats for us due to we had to stay on separated during the entire journey.
I had some reservations been this leg part of a Delta itinerary I was not sure how CI would compare to DL economy comfort seat. Taipei-SFO economy smooth check-in well organize boarding seat 34A quite comfortable 32 pitch and personal AVOD. Departed on time at 23.50 informed crew not to serve dinner and I was left undisturbed and slept well till breakfast food was good for economy. Overall good flight and the crew were polite and interacted well I will fly again with CI now that are an integral part of the Skyteam.;The experience was fine with comfortable seat, timely departure, good food and entertainment, and friendly crew. I would fly again with them.
"SFO-Taipei-Bangkok (economy). SFO flight leaves at 1.30am but if you're planning to sleep tough luck - the hot meal is served at 3am and everyone (even if sleeping) is ordered to sit bolt upright so the person behind can eat. This was repeated at midnight on the return Taipei-SFO. Hot meal SFO -Taipei was disgusting. I would highly recommend you bring your own food. Kids meals were average both ways. Service was otherwise ok. Entertainment generally good - 747 screens have higher definition brightness and contrast than A330s where video quality is poor. Movie selection fairly good but can be limiting if you fly transpacific both ways the same month. Seat pitch a little tight at 32"" for the tall. Boarding was highly organized at SFO but more chaotic at Taipei.";The entertainment was good, movie selection was a bit limited, service was average, food was disgusting while kids meal was average.
HKG-KHH return. Both trips A330-300. Outbound trip delayed 2 hours due to fuel problems and it resulted in refuelling. Staff were quick to serve the complaining passengers. The inflight entertainment system is quite good. The price was very reasonable as it was near the Easter holiday peak.;The price offer was good. However, the flight got delayed due to refueling. The crew service and flight entertainment were good.
SUB-SIN-SUB all in A330-300. Outbound flight departed 30 mins late. A full flight but FA's were attentive and their English proficiency good. Food was also good. Landed 30 mins late inbound flight departed and arrived on time. Only 5 pax in J Class. Pre take-off drinks served immediately upon boarding. Seats were pretty comfortable. FA's were nice and friendly.;There was a little delay in flight. The staff were attentive and responsive. The food, beverages, and seat comfort was all ok.
LAX to Beijing return in economy class. Outbound flight was a newer Boeing 777 return flight an older Boeing 747. Both flights departed on time I slept well on both flights for 8 of the 12 hours. Food was fine and staff friendly.;The overall experience was good with fine food and service quality. 
AMS-BKK-TPE-HKG. Renewed business class is not that comfortable it is an improvement to the old business class. Food quality remained basic but acceptable service is good when flight is empty once flight is crowded cabin crew seem to loose control. Price of flight is still cheaper then other airlines lounge in BKK HKG and Taipei airport are fine with nice snacks. AMS lounge is the Skyteam KLM lounge - food is bad but what can you expect when in the Netherlands.;The business class experience was just average. The seating not much comfy, foods were basic while service quality was ok.
SYD-TPE-YVR return. I was unsure and a bit sceptical. Overall my friend and I were really happy the food was excellent the staff lovely and the entertainment great. The cabin crew spoke good English and were always around to offer assistance. The only issue we had was two excruciatingly long stop-overs. (18hrs outbound and 17 on return). The seats weren't the best ever but could've been worse.;The overall experience was good because the food was nice, staff was friendly, and the entertainment system worked well.
AMS-BKK-TPE and back. Outbound a 747 with no AVOD just centralized screens. Decent meals topped with friendly and professional cabin crew. On the return - modern IFE with touch screens but flight attendants not quite as effective. Troubles with processing my wheelchair at TPE but that may be inefficacy of the airport. In general good service/price ratio.;The food was nice, entertainment fine, only the crew was not very helpful and effective.
NRT-TPE-BKK return. Impressed with service and the level of English for most flight attendants. AVOD was good. Seats on A330-300s are fine but recline to a very uncomfortable slide rather than flat. Provided plenty of English magazines though newspapers were scarce. Lounge in BKK excellent with hot and cold dishes. Flight was 1 hr late leaving BKK but were given a meal voucher in the airport despite the fact food in the lounge was ample. Connecting in Taipei was easy as it's not a very large airport. If the prices in business class remain a bargain I will be flying China Airlines more in the future.;A wonderful business class experience. The cabin staff served very well, seat was a bit uncomfortable in a sense that it doesn’t go flat with recline. Lounges and meals were best.
BNE-AKL Business Class Jan 2012. Boarding was well organized and the fight punctual. Food for lunch was good quality although there was no proper dessert. Problem was that the service felt very rushed even though it was a 3 hour flight. A particular problem I have encountered on all CI flights is that the crew seem unable to co-ordinate the service of wine with food and then to keep glasses topped up even in a small business class cabin. Twice I had to use the call button in order to get some wine. Although it was answered instantly this is no substitute for a proper drinks trolley service. Notwithstanding this the cabin crew were unfailingly friendly and helpful in their attitude. Unfortunately my bag came last off the carousel last rather than enjoying the advertised priority.;The flight was on time and the boarding process was swift. The service was average and the cabin crew was just rushing through it. The priority service for baggage did not work for me.
LAX-TPE-MNL twice in the past year. Seats in economy seem small to me (I am over 6 ft. FA's are attentive but not very friendly - seems to be due to somewhat limited English. When I asked for drinks in Chinese they were much more social. The food was good if you ordered Chinese option. TPE is not my favorite airport but it is orderly and clean.;The seating was not very comfortable me due to my tall height. The service was average but the english communication skills were limited. Chinese food was good.
Short hop from BNE to AKL. Check-in staff member was helpful and friendly and the wait was minimal. The flight departed thirty minutes late but were kept well informed. The meal service was cheerful with a selection of mains. The in-seat entertainment was clunky and poorly designed and the language selection confusing to say the least. Seat width and comfort were as expected for economy and the staff pleasant and fluent in English. Overall an enjoyable and professional service.;An overall pleasant experience. The staff were quite supportive and fiendly. The seat was fine, meals were good but the entertainment system was not that great.
Auckland to Brisbane (my wife had wheel chair assistance) and we were very impressed by the level of comfort and service. It was the cheapest price and the fare included a meal and movie. The legroom was a little tight the level of English was difficult to understand at times - announcements given first in Chinese then in English. Cabin temperature way too warm and the aircraft appeared to have no personal air vents above. The staff were friendly and polite.;An impressive experience of price vs quality with China airlines. The seat legroom was a bit less, temperature was high, and the english communication was difficult to understand. The service quality was fine.
Auckland to Brisbane. Good flight and crew. The meal choice was Beef Noodles or Curried Chicken. Crew responded to request promptly but had a lack of the English language.;There were two available food options, the service and experience was fine overall.
Shanghai to Sydney. We booked this flight at very short notice and were slightly apprehensive. However we need not have worried. Despite the very short notice my wife and I were seated together. The aircraft was a very new looking A330 and we found our Economy class seats very comfortable. The standard of cabin service was not bad with the crew even managing to accommodate our special meal requests. Although the flight departed slightly late from Shanghai due to problems when inbound from Beijing we actually arrived on schedule at Sydney. Ultimately we were very pleased with the flight and service received and will certainly consider flying China Airlines again.;A pleasant experience with China airlines. The cabin service was good and the food requests were well accomodated. The flight was a bit delayed but arrived at the destination on time.
PRG-FRA-TPE return. Codeshare with CSA (PRG-FRA segment). FRA-TPE flight was operated with B747 instead of usual A340. Cabin crew attentive and helpful meals were tasty and refreshments between meals provided on demand. Outdated centralized AV system but worked ok. The big downside of the flight was AC - it was really cold. Return flight (TPE-FRA) with standard A340 (2-4-2 in economy) was fine. AC settings were correct personalised AVOD system worked without problems with a great selection of movies and music. Meals and drinks were fine and cabin crew helpful.;A nice experience with helpful staff, good service, tasty meals, and good entertainment.
SUB-SIN return. Outbound in Y Class. Departed on time cabin crew friendly food was fine. We arrived in Singapore ahead of schedule. Inbound in C Class. Late evening departure but was delayed 30 mins. Pre take- off drinks were served immediately. Seats are lie-flat and pretty comfortable cabin crew attentive and polite food was tasty. Our luggage was on the carousel very quickly.;A fine business class experience with friendly crew, fine food, minimal flight delay, comfortable seats, and quick baggage arrival.
FRA-TPE-BKK return. FRA-TPE sector full on old A340-300 clean with 2x4x2 configuration. Seats comfortable with adjustable headrest and footrest. After boarding flight was delayed for 2 hours. FAs handed out slippers headset IFE and Duty free catalogue. AVOD started and staff served drinks. AVOD with just 12 current movies 40 oldies in several languages games music etc. FAs mainly young and well presented. After 1 hour another 3 hour delay announced and FAs served hot lunch. On departure drinks offered and duty free. During the flight FAs offered sandwiches and soft drinks. Breakfast (2 choices) served before arrival and purser provided information about connecting flights. CAL offered day rooms and meals at Taipei for passengers who had late evening connecting flights. TPE-BKK on old B747-400 with no PTV just a main screen - lunch served with better quality and quantity than TPE-FRA. Return flights on A340-300 and similar experience.;The flight was delayed for several hours after boarding. However, the seats were quite comfortable, entertainment had limited options, foods and beverages were well served. The flight attendants were nice. At Taipei airport, meals and rooms were arranged for travellers with late evening flights.
LHR-TPE-DPS return in Y. Ground staff polite and helpful cabin crew attentive some better then the others. LHR- TPE-LHR very good cabin presence offering water and juice. AVOD good with some current movies to choose from. Two good quality meals served LHR-TPE-LHR and one TPE-DPS-TPE. Baggage arrived quickly. Seats reasonable comfortable on A340 and very comfortable on B738 (try getting row 16/17 as much more legroom). Would fly with them again especially as it was £600 for the ticket.;A great value for money experience. The good cabin crew and environment, fine service, good quality meals and beverages, and entertainment all add up to a great experience.
Taipei to Tokyo round trip twice this summer. Services provided on flights from TSA to HND are more improved than other routes. Free slippers earphones blankets and pillows are placed in the seat pocket when boarding. Attendants with mediocre language skills still served well meals were fine with two main selections captain's inflight broadcast was clear and fluent in Mandarin English and Japanese which meets most of the passengers' need onboard. Although the price was a little high compared to TPE-NRT where TSA-HND is considered a business route the service and punctuality still made the journey worthwhile.;The experience was worth the money spent. The service quality was better than others, good amenities were provided, the staff was hospitable with average language skills, and the announcements were quite clear.
BKK-AMS with old 747-400. Got a bargain deal with China Airlines. Legroom just about okay (I am 180 cm tall). FA's busy but still smiling. Flight 02.20 am was delayed 1 hour and after boarding they left lights on for hours during service. Our children tried very hard to sleep despite the noise from service and tax-free shopping. No IFE onboard.;The seat legroom was enough, flight was delayed for 1 hour. Due to lights-on and noise, it was hard to fall asleep. 
NRT-TPE-HKT. Connecting in Taipei was a 3 hour wait but the last call for boarding was 30 min before boarding time. We were rushed to the gate to be met with a huge line and a 20 min wait. Meals were mediocre and they waited nearly 1 hour to clear away trays. Having to wait so long before going to sleep was very uncomfortable.;A lot of waiting at the boarding gate and then during the flight after meal was served to clear trays, made the journey quite uncomfortable.
TPE-YVR-TPE. A340-300s. E-Checkin and Self Print Boarding Passes were quick and easy to use at Taipei. Boarding commenced with proper order according to zones. After takeoff the Fantasy Sky AVOD was immediately turned on slippers and headsets handed out. AVOD had a selection of 101 movies meals were tasty and served hot numerous drink rounds were made. Toothbrushes put out during the night and restrooms were kept clean by FA's. Delayed on the return due to technical issues however the purser and FA's handled the situation well. Announcements from the captain were made quickly and FA's quickly began drink rounds. AVOD was started as soon as the drink rounds finished.;A great facility was e-check-in and self print boarding passes at Taipei. The cabin environemt and service was great, amenity kits were provided on time, meals were hot and savoury.The entertainemt was having good collection.
TPE-FRA A340-300. Check-In was smooth and ground staff gave our luggage priority. Cabin was clean. Crew nice and attentive. After departure given drinks ear phones and slippers then a meal service - vegetarian meal was very tasty. Cabin staff made beverage and snack services during night time and 3 hours before arrival a second meal service. Seats were comfortable and had IFE with AVOD.;The swift check-in, priority luggage, tidy cabin, resposive staff, good meals, and nice entertainment all add up to a fine experience.
The First Class cabin is very good full 180 degrees flat sea the food was great and there was very nice service from the flight attendants. I looking forward to using China Airlines again.;A comfortable seat, tasty food and great service.
LAX-Manila return. Refurbished 747 to Taipei still looks old but nice movie selections. Disappointed with the food though service was efficient and the flight was mostly on time. Although not on par with Cathay or Asiana it's still a good airline.;The service quite efficient, good movie collection, and timely flight. The food was disappointing.
Vancouver-Manila I was so impressed with the service I received form China Airlines. I am not new to flying having worked internationally for 23 yrs on all continents except Australia. The meals come quickly and the tray only sits infront of you for 15 mins tops and is removed The cabin staff are so efficient. I look forward to travelling with this airline again and again.;The service was impressive and the foods were good. I would fly with them in future.
Been travelling with China Airlines 4 times now. And I have to say it is quite a service you get plus comfortable seats with LCD screen lots of movies (even new movies which just released) games. I have nothing to complain about. The food is acceptable and they are mostly right on the time with the flights. Only one time it has been late at arriving. However it was only 30 mins which is acceptable for me.;A good service, comfortable seats, good food and entertainment is a big plus.
SYD-JFK via TPE/KIX. All flights arrived on time. Sydney-Taipei flights (A330) have the long haul 166 degree angled flat beds. Taipei-New York was in the first newly refurbished 747 which is the same business product as Thai Airlines/Gulf Air/Turkish. Excellent product and nice new pillows and soft duvets. Food high quality and AVOD lots of choice. Quick transfer at TPE but total journey was 29hrs. The price justified the route and choice of airline. Would fly again.;A good value for the price that was paid. The product was excellent with comfortable seats and pilllows, great quality food and a lot of options for entertainment.
TPE-SFO. Flight was 2 hours late due to late arrival of aircraft and later a mechanical failure. Boarding chaotic and disorganized. Very tired cabin flickering lights dirty overhead projectors no PTVs not even air nozzles. Blackout twice during taxi and crew had to manually perform safety demo which took up 10 mins both in Chinese and English. They try very hard to sound pleasant and friendly with their English but it doesn't work without 'pleases' and 'thank yous'. Food ok. Overall I regretted paying more for such an outdated product. They're currently upgrading their cabins but that's no excuse for the poorly co-ordinated delay and rudeness.;The flight was delayed and the boarding was disorganized. The food was average. Overall the product was outdated and crew not friendly. I regret paying for it.
I purchased our tickets refundable Business class for the family to Europe. A medical surgery came up and we had to cancel - since we have fully refundable I didn't think it would be a problem. I read through the terms prior to purchasing. After getting the runaround from the Bangkok sales office I was finally told to do it online. In order to get a refund you have to agree to wait 45 days for the charge back to a credit card. Of course this wasn't mentioned during the purchasing process. I called the ticket office and they told me it would be much longer than 45 days. We will get a refund but weren't prepared for the lengthy time.;The refuding got longer than 45 days and it was not mentioned in the purchasing process.
"Flights on China Airlines are fine. My complaint is about their frequent flyer program. Don't bother. They give you an award ticket for 30000 miles but it is only good for Hawaii which has no Availability through the year end (a full 12 months at the time of our attempt) at which point the ticket is no longer valid. So we had to make a special request to ""downgrade"" our award to 25000 miles so we could chose any flight in the continental US. Still pretty much impossible to get a ticket. The stupid thing is the staff will sit with you on the phone for hours trying. First they have to plug in a specific flight both outbound and return and then wait for their partner airline to get back to them. It is always unavailable even though the super saver discounted tickets are still not sold out on the web site. So they not only waste my time but they pay their staff to sit on the phone and go through this useless exercise. Eventually the staff will tell you that they can't stay on the phone all day!";A lot of trouble caused due to the award ticket from the frequent flyer program. The staff could not help.
Brisbane to Auckland Easter Friday and flight was very busy. An ageing A330 seats were rather hard and uncomfortable. IFE was very good and offered a range of movies and music. The service was above average with a good meal and tea and coffee offered. The service was efficient but not polite and had an indifferent aspect to it. If the price does not remain competitive I would not use this airline again.;The aircraft was old and the seats were very uncomfortable. The food, entertainment, and service were fine. The staff were not polite.
Flew economy LAX to TPE. Flight was late 30 minutes at least taking off. Then after take off the estimated arrival time kept being moved back. The flight ended up 1 hour 25 minutes late landing. Flight was completely full - to the point they were weighing bags and people. The check staff literally told people to get on the scales. The plane was an upgraded 747-400 that had personally video screens in economy seats were very narrow and the seat pitch was painful. Food portions tiny. No more hot towels provided upon boarding and before landing.;The flight was delayed, the seats were very uncomfortable, and the meal serving size was too small.
We booked our return trip LHR-BNE in August 2010 with China Airlines. We are due to depart from LHR on the 10/4/2011. Two days before our departure China airlines called and cancelled our flight due to the cancellation of the flight from Taipei to BNE. They didn't give us any reason and not even try to find us the alternative route. Although we have the full refund we have to find another airlines in the last minute. Luckily we are able to get on another airlines but it cost us £600 extra due to last minute fare. We are so disgusted with China Airlines and we would not recommend China Airlines to anyone. It is a joke that a 4-star airline provide such a terrible service.;Terrible service from China airlines. The flight was cancelled two days before departure and no alternatives were provided. We had to purchase expensive tickets on the last moment.
Two weeks ago my wife and I travelled to Taipei and Hong Kong on China Airlines Economy Class. On both ways we find the services worthy of high commendation. Both the ground staff and the attendants prompt courteous and responsible to the customer needs and details. The food and beverage were sufficient and of excellent quality.;The experience was fine and commendable. The staff was very courteous, the service and the food were great.
BKK-YVR. Planes new but had a 3 hour mechanical in BKK so missed connection in Taiwan. It felt like they had this problem many times before. As I was on a bereavement fare they placed me in the bulkhead with no other seats occupied in the row (seems nice) When I boarded there was a family of 15 with at least 8 kids from India. I was told there were no other seats available but after 8 hours of screams and people sleeping and crawling on me and other passengers getting upset they moved me to 1st class where there appeared to be several empty seats. After being lied to and putting up with sub-par food and no sleep the flight attendant moved me to avoid a scene. I would fly another airline next time even if it's a little more money.;The experience was quite poor with substandard food and no-sleep environment.
CGK-LAX-CGK last time was not entirely satisfying. CGK-TPE was good with TV screen on the back seat though it was only 5 hours flight. I continued my 16 hours flight TPE-LAX with no TV screen on the back seat and it was boring. China Airlines lounge in Taipei is good. Staff are friendly good snacks and drinks. I count it as a compensation to my disappointment to long- hours flight with no TV screen.;The staff was friendly and the Taipei lounge was satisfying. However, the disappointment comes from the missing flight entertainment system on 16 hour flight.
Supposed to fly LHR-TPE-SYD flights changed at short notice to LHR-AMS-BKK-TPE-SYD adding 13 hrs to journey - no explanation. Given 45 hr trip with 11 hrs at Taipei : not good with 4 yr old and 9 yr old. Rice or noodles every meal - my kids didn't eat whole journey. On the plus side they did give us a complimentary hotel room in Taipei.;The flight schedule was changed on a short notice without any explanation.
LAX-Taipei-Denpasar traveling in Economy with an active three year old. We were given bulkhead seats before we got to the airport. Got to LAX and was ushered to the almost non existent Business Class queue as I had a young child. My son was accompanied without this being requested by a friendly steward when we got on the plane as I had too much to carry (I took his FAA approved car seat with us). His kids meals arrived without prompting and were favorably received. On the Denpasar leg I asked for his kids meal before they were being served as my son was hungry - it arrived two minutes later with a smile. We were also offered the choice of moving into an empty four seat section on this leg so that we could rest more comfortably. Throughout the service was wonderful. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Plus the flights were on time the toilets were always clean and the adult food was perfectly acceptable too.;The flight experience was good overall with a young kid. The kids meal arrived on time. The adult meal was also good. The flights were timely, seats were comfortable, and the toilets were kept clean.
LAX - Hanoi via Taipei return Business Class. Overall very good service at a very reasonable price. Service attentive (almost too attentive). Seats not lie-flat but able to sleep on both trans-Pacific legs. Overall service is very similar to US domestic business class at about half the cost. Would fly with them again at this level of pricing.;A very good service experience for the money paid. The flight was comfortable.
TPE-PEK. Upgraded to Business Class at boarding as wanted some peace on this morning flight. Business class on B747-400 is sort of angled lie-flat but I would not be happy to spend 14h on a transpacific flight in one of those seats. Service polite and friendly and food is not bad. I could sleep a bit and I found the upper deck seats to be better and also the best seats are the ones in row 9. I was quite happy with this flight and think they are a good airline. Four star and no more though. Seat is really borderline for Business class.;I feel happy and satisfied with China airlines. The cabin crew were friendly and courteous, the seat was just average for business class but it was still comfortable.
Brisbane to Auckland. China Airlines have recently added this sector and are offering a full service flight at a very reasonable price and flight times are excellent. A340 was spotless on demand IFE was very good meal was pretty good. Crew were very attentive not a full trip probably only 60%.;China airlines offered a very good price and flight times. The experience was wonderful on a new plane, with good food and entertainment.
LHR-TPE return in business - rescheduled return via Frankfurt due to unexplained and unhelpful cancellation of original flight. Outbound crew excellent but food not as good as usual. Seats not lie-flat but fine for resting. Return service noticably poorer and dinner rushed on the basis that it was a night flight. Personally I expect the choice of a full or express service and had the same problem last time I flew this route. Overall a fair and pleasant business product for the price.;The return flight was rescheduled. The service on return was not very good and the food was average. Overall, fine product for the price.
LHR-TPE-SYD. Food drink and service were good. Lounge at Taipei not brilliant but good enough. Priority baggage seemed to come off last for all of us that had a connecting flight in Taipei. Return flight arrives in TPE before anything opens and seemingly before any staff arrived - a nightmare working out where to go. Airline staff were very friendly couldn't do enough for you.;The meal and beverage service was fine. Priority baggage came last. Staff was friendly.
Vancouver to Bali back and forth - no PTV on seats and old 747 aircraft. Even if it's 1500$ cheaper then flying other airlines I'll never fly with China airlines again.;The old aircraft with no entertainment system. 
Sydney - Taipei - Vienna in Business. Stopped overnight at Sunmoon Lake Taiwan to catch connected Vienna service. Flew CI last year and the service is still good. Qantas lounge in Sydney excellent CI lounge in Taipei ok limited drinks and food. On board service good but they really need to review serving breakfast three hours before arrival in Taipei when the flight arrives at 4.10 am. This could have been done 1.5 hours prior. Would fly again if they keep the fares low and continue to offer the better airbus business class seats on the route that I wish to fly.;The overall service was good. Only the breakfast serving time was too early. I would fly again if the fares remain low.
Sydney-Taipei-Peking-Taipei-Sydney. I was impressed with service on the ground and onboard. The inflight service didn't have many 'trappings' (eg. no hot-towel before departure) as some airlines do but was sincere with good interaction from flight attendants. Food was very tasty and woolong tea was the great drink to wind up a meal. The downer was the limited leg room on the A330-300 between Sydney and Taipei considering it was a long-haul night flight. The flights between Taipei and Peking were much more pleasant.;An impressive service experience from the staff. The food and drinks were the best. The only downside was less legroom for the long-haul flight.
Heathrow-Taipei-Sydney return in Economy. Surprised how good the service was as expectations were low due to low price. Good travelling times. Good food although got a bit fed up with rice and noodles. Staff happy to get drinks. Taipei airport not the best. Didn't open till 6am so had to sit on floor with no food drinks or information for an hour or so. Plane not full on way back so had 2 seats each and lay down.;A good service experience for the low price, nice crew, good food, and comfortable journey.
TPE-JFK. Business class price wise. Boeing 747-400 old cabin design inadequate seating (outdated sleeperettes) broken legrest. Food good but little and poorly presented. Nuts and rice crackers as snacks during more than 15 hour flight. inattentive crew. Waited four days for luggage after arrival.;The aircraft was old and outdated, uncomfortable seating, small food servings and late luggage arrival.
AMS-BKK return in Dynasty. Dynasty class is excellent value in the increasingly costly world of premium cabin flying. KLM Air France British Airways and Thai Airways do this route with noticeably flatter seats wider menu choice and better AVOD but you pay accordingly. It's down to choice and the size of your wallet I guess. Well organised boarding attentive service good drink choice on time departures and arrivals. Plane is a little older than some but it's clean and well maintained. Overall a great choice for those who want a biz class service without breaking the bank.;A fine business class experience with swift boarding process, attentive service, good meal and beverage options, and a well maintained aircraft.
LHR-TPE-DPS return. Paid £540 for a return flight to Bali. We were very impressed by the excellent service and friendliness from crew on each. Inflight entertainment good. Food fine and plenty of it they keep you fed regularly. We did find the flight home from Bali to Heathrow long ie. Bali to Taipei 5 hours - Taipei to LHR 14.5 hrs. We would probably use China Airlines again if the prices remain reasonable but would ideally take a shorter route if the prices were similar.;The staff was quite friendly and the service was impressive, the food was fine, and the entertainment options were good.
Brisbane to Hong Kong via TPE return Business Class. Check in brilliant in Brisbane Air NZ lounge in Brisbane fantastic with plenty of food and refreshments. The seats definitely need improving on A330-300 but managed to get about 4 hours sleep. The service in the air was the best in a long time. Attentive and willing to supply drinks and or food. Meal also very good. TPE to HK was on 737. Return the same. It's great value for money in business class.;A good value for price experience for business class. The seats need renovation while the service and meals were great.
LHR-TPE-DPS return. The price was £500 for weekend daytime flights. Flights between UK and Taipei were full but you can call the airline to pre-book seats. A340 has 2-4-2 configuration so if you're travelling as a couple it is easy to relax if you book the window seats. Flights between Taipei and Bali were half full and we were given exit seats in both directions. Food was ok but don't expect Western food to be great. Entertainment system between UK and Taiwan excellent. Huge selection of current films shows CD albums and games. Check in staff ground staff and cabin crew all very helpful. Taipei airport was ok - worth noting that a new terminal is nearing completion and it looks very modern. Overall a very enjoyable experience and I would use this airline again. Prices probably will start to creep up as they become more established in the UK market.;The food was average, the entertainment selection was great, and the staff was very supportive and friendly. The overall flight was pleasant.
SYD to LHR via Taipei Business Class. China Airlines use the Qantas Business Lounge at SYD - good food choice of drinks and nice showers. China Airlines Business Class seat is comfortable for sitting but for sleeping it is way off the standard as the seats are not flat or even angled flat. The meals have deteriorated over the last few years. The wine selection is poor amenity kit is a waste of space - why do they bother. IFE is good films are not that up to date but there is a reasonable selection. Taipei Business lounge not great the T2 lounge better than T1 lounge. They use the Sky Team lounge at LHR which is very busy in the early evening but an hour or so before the 1000pm departure it is quiet pleasant. Really nice shower at LHR. Overall when compared to other Business products on this route you get what you paid for.;For the business class, the seat was comfortable for sitting not for sleeping. The meals were not so great and the entertainment selection was reasonable.
LHR-TPE on A340-300 and TPE-DPS on B737-800 return. Chosen because of price and the A343 had AVOD making 13-14 hour flight more bearable. Good selection of films and shows with choice of languages. I had bulkhead seat due to my height bit narrow but legroom gain made up for it despite sitting next to families with babies! Food ok two full meal service and sandwiches available between. The drinks service was minimal as reported by others ( 1 small glass of wine with dinner) but staff happy to provide drinks when asked. Staff friendly and attentive. 90 minute delay on way back in Taipei gate desk had a complimentary drinks station set up within 30 minutes shows good customer service. Taipei airport is being renovated but as had only 1-2 hours transfer time no issue free Wifi and internet terminals available makes passing time easier.;great entertainment selection made the flight easy. The meals and snacks were fine. The drinks serving was minimal but staff willing to provide additional. Overall good customer service.
Business class from Amsterdam to Bangkok. Seats are not up to the standard of most airlines but cost is significantly less and represents value for money. Staff onboard very friendly and service good. Return journey delayed by 24 hours with no explanation connection from Amsterdam back to UK changed for no apparent reason causing a 6 hour wait (this has happened on both occasions I used the airline). Staff at desk in terminal building at Amsterdam very rude and unhelpful. Staff at China airlines in London equally rude in never replying to several communications which were simply asking if such changes are standard procedure prior to making further bookings. Pity the ground staff do not match the standards of the ones I met on the flights. Doubt very much if I will consider this airline again despite the cost savings having flown this route countless times problem free with other airlines and having so many options to select from.;Seats were substandard for the business class. The flight was delayed for 24 hours without any reason explanation. The staff was quite rude in communication. I will doubt considering this airline in future.
Sydney-Taipei-Heathrow. This airline was cheapest by a long shot and suggested by the travel agent. Seating was adequate. Inflight entertainment pretty good as was food. The staff at check in and on board were lovely and extremely polite and helpful. Would definitely fly with again the only downside is the route - 14.5 hours from Taipei to Heathrow and the amount of time spent waiting at Taipei airport for connecting flights as Taipei airport is probably not the best place to waste 6 hours. Take a good book and a packed lunch.;The seat, entertainment, and food were all good. The cabin crew were polite and courteous. 
BKK-AMS. The night flight from BKK was again very poor. Food was served quickly and of a poor standard - given the smallest glass of wine with the meal and then during the flight no water runs. I had to go to the galley every time I wanted anything. Big screen was poor and not working correctly. I use China Airlines as they were a cheap way to get to Thailand. I wont be using them again if possible.;The experience was terrible. The food quality was very low, after meal no drinks served during the flight, also, flight entertainment system was not working properly.
AMS-BKK. China Airlines are getting worse on this route. It's still the old B747 which really needs upgrading. Your are time-warped back to the 70's when you get onboard. Fuzzy big screens should be a thing of the past. The food is okay stewards are OK if a bit miserable with the beer wine and a smile!;The aircraft needs updation and the entertainment screens are old-fashioned. The food and crew service were average.
LAX-TPE-HKG-TPE-LAX economy. Very cheap fares. Punctual. Attentive and friendly flight attendants. The food quality was fine and consistent throughout all flights. A tip - if you fly an Asia-based airline choose the Asian dish if given a choice between the Asian and Western dish. Obviously they'll be far more skilled at preparing the Asian dish. My only complaints are the dearth of movie selections (they remain unchanged two weeks later on my return trip) and the lack of individual air nozzles. On each of my flights the entertainment system was individual.;Comapred to the low price, quality of service was good enough. The attentive staff, good food, and private entertainment screens were a big plus. The movie selection was a bit limited.
Sydney to Taipei to Frankfurt on Dynasty Class. Excellent attentive service and inflight entertainment comfortable seats and delicious meals and plentiful drinks. Would certainly travel with them again.;The best service experience with responsive crew, great food, plenty of drinks, comfortable seats and great entertainment.
AMS-BKK-TPE. The business class seats on the 747-400 were just seats no beds. No plug for laptop no entertainment system (except 4 tv channels). The food was so-so they even served foie gras! Rice dry and sticky. Prices are friendly but for business class travel I would recommend another airline on this route.;The business class seats were not worth for sleeping. No sockets and only four channel entertainment. The foods were just average.
BNE-TPE-LHR return. China Airlines gives deep discounts for business travel and at these prices the product is marvellous value. Punctuality on flights was quite good. Staff were keen and attentive but found it difficult to coordinate service of bread and sometimes wine with the meals even though the cabin was small. Amount of food very substantial and quality good. AVOD good. My principle bugbear is that they close the window blinds on day flights. This is not something people would do at home and never happens on surface transport.;A business class product worth the price paid. The flights were on time, staff were nice but coordination sometimes becomes difficult. The food and entertainment were a big plus.
Brisbane-Taiwan-Vienna. A330 on first leg excellent. Seats don't recline fully. Inflight entertainment not as good as Singapore Airlines or Emirates. Taiwan to Vienna on A340-300 slightly older planes and seats not as comfortable. Return leg was great. Food was good and planes on time.;The aircraft was new on the first leg but the entertainment was lacking. The second leg was not comfortable. The return was great.
TPE-HKG round trip. The ground staff were helpful in both Taipei and Hong Kong while I was handling with seat and luggage problems. However the inflight attendants still have to work hard on their service attitude. Food as usual but can be improved.;The staff was helpful in solving the seat and luggage problems. The food and service need improvement.
I booked business class seats for my daughter and elderly father to travel Sydney to Frankfurt via Taipei. They could not have been happier with the service provided including wheelchair assistance at Taipei and Frankfurt airports. Food very good but most impressive was the attention care and respect shown by staff towards my 88 year old father.;The staff was very respectful and caring towards my old father. The food was also ver good.
JFK New York -Taipei was one of the worst flights we've been on. Very old planes with uncomfortable seats and no personal TV's in seats. For such a long flight it was extremely unpleasant. They played some very old movies on the small ancient overhead TV's. All in all it was the cheapest flight we could get at the last minute so if there's any consolation that would be it. We got what we paid for.;The old aircrafts with uncomfortable seats and old-fashioned overhead TV. The movie collection was also ancient.
HKG-LAX via TPE. TPE-LAX flight was good as they offered me 2 meals plus a snack. IFE was not bad and they have most of the current popular movies on there. Business Class section was somewhat cold most of the flight but they did give me 2 blankets. HKG-TPE was at best a 5/10. The cabin was cold and they offered only a snack and a drink (they claimed to give 2 drinks on short-haul Business Class cabin).;The flight was good with good food and updated entertainment system. The cabin was too cold.
Boarding at Brussels was smooth and on time. Food served was a kind of cheese cake that tasted OK but was rather poorly presented. Anyway it was better than the uninspired  sandwich Lufthansa served in business class on previous flights I took with them recently. Seats in business class are the same as in economy with the seat next to you kept free which is a plus giving the feeling of being a bit more Covid safe. Disembarking in Frankfurt was at an apron position and all passengers were packed together in a bus that drove us to the terminal. This really didn’t feel Covid safe and I really disliked this. If they have to bus passengers to the terminal can’t they just not divide the transfer in 2 busses so people don’t have to stand shoulder to shoulder during the drive?;The boarding process wa smooth. The food was badly presented. The cabin seating arrangement was covid safe but the bus arrangement in Frankfurt was not covid safe.
Disgusting service, they wouldn't let me on the plane without paper PCR even though it says electronic is fine online! A sweetheart of lady called Cvijeta printed it for me last second. That woman should get a medal.;The terrible service experience. They would not let me board the aircraft without paper PCR.
The communication and responsibility for customer is the worst I have ever seen. We had connected flight Vilnius - Frankfurt - Miami. The first flight was late for 1 hour. In Frankfurt airport weren't enough workers and we spent in an enormous queue. Even we asked a few workers to let us to go to the plane - nobody cared.  Communication and attitude, responsibility are something the company doesn't understand.  Lufthansa didn't take responsibility for its mistake.;The customer service experience was too bad. The staff did not seem responsible and the communication and behavior with the customers was unacceptable.
I have flown with Lufthansa many times in the past (pre covid). I recently flew return Bristol to Cape via Frankfurt, choose seats on online check in, got to check in desk they had been changed on both legs of our journey. Don't really know where to start with the food from Frankfurt - Cape Town, dry cold pasta with the tiniest bit of sauce, hard roll, breakfast- a green wrap with cheese and pesto? Same on return leg apart from wrap swapped for hard cheese roll. A lot of people complaining. Check in at Cape town, absolute chaos, 1hr 45, told to fill in 'Traveller Health Questionnaire' at last minute, very stressful, a lot of confused check in staff. Don't think I will be flying Lufthansa until I hear they have improved.;Lufthansa has lost the standards. The food was disgusting and cold, a lot of chaos at check in Cape town, the health questionnaire was given at the last moment causing lots of stress. The staff were confused.
Want to thank Becky at Lufthansa Manchester at check-in, when I needed to have a printed copy of my PCR result for final destination (Zimbabwe), Let me send the email from my phone to Lufthansa where she later printed it and it was waiting for me at the boarding gate. That's going the extra mile. Well done.;The staff was very helpful in printing my PCR that was required for final destination. I appreciate the staff a lot.
Lufthansa's European Business Class product is similar to most other carriers - the seats are the same as Economy except for the empty middle one. This affords a little more space and privacy. The other point of difference is the food served. The boarding at FRA was chaotic. Several Economy Class passengers slipped into the Priority lane and there was nobody to monitor this transgression. The whole purpose of paying Business Class is to have a premium experience. Lufthansa failed utterly in providing the basic of this product. Most of the Lufthansa A320neo aircraft have no WiFi. And there is no other form of entertainment. Truly, Lufthansa seems to be aiming at recreating the Stone Age era of aviation. The only saving grace of Lufthansa these days is the outstanding onboard service.;The good part was the onboard service. But the experience that was expected from a business class product was not felt with the Lufthansa airline. The seating was similar to economy, entertainment was missing, food average, chaotic boarding etc.
Mumbai to Frankfurt was served by 20+ years old A340-300. The Business Class seats have seen better days, are narrow, lumpy, and not exactly premium. The Business Class lavatories were indistinguishable from Economy Class. The bright spot in the Lufthansa long haul Business Class offering these days is the exceptional onboard service. On this particular flight  the inflight WiFi was not working (I paid for it and requested a refund).;The aircraft was decades old. Nothing premium for the business class, seating, lavatories were the same as that of business class. Wifi was not working. The onboard service was good.
The most uncomfortable seats, cabin service-a joke. For a 3hr flight a tiny piece of chocolate, coffee for 3€. I know it’s because of covid.;The uncomfortable seats and ofcourse uncomfortable flight.
The staff at the Seoul check-in were extremely unfriendly and uninterested in any form of customer service. The food was the driest, most tasteless meal I have had onboard. Then the Munich airport business lounge was not even worth one star. Lack of choices in food and not properly chilled drinks. On top of that, you can expect the reception staff to be very blunt. The lady who cleans the shower booth yelled at me for not having waited standby near the shower booth when the shower was ready.  When she found a translator I asked for an apology for her attitude but I did not get one. I reached out to Lufthansa customer service to file complaint but did not hear back back.;The staff was non-courteous, the meals were tasteless, the business lounge not worth, reception staff very rude. A careless customer service!
Beirut to Toronto via Frankfurt. Pros: Reliable flight and no delays. Cons : Customer service is null. Cold Food sandwich. Mean employee with no sense of welcoming. No entertainment and even a plug to charge phone. Not all info are in English.;The flights were on time but customer service was poor. The food, staff friendliness, entertainment, and phone chargers were missign.
"They cancel flights at will. They do not respond to emails! Spent 3 days holding on to various calls. Complete waste of time.  Most airlines are very accommodating on this route. Given, it is a twelve hour flight. Lufthansa Beverages appalling. The seat had insufficient padding and back/neck support for a long-haul flight.  The staff were surly and rude. Kept bumping into us passengers, The plane was however new and clean; and in good order. I will never fly Lufthansa again. ";The customer service was poor, rude staff,  no response to customer emails and calls. Although, the plane was new but the seat was uncomfortable on the long haul flight. 
The quality of food is poor, we got a cold meal (German sausage salad) on our 2.5 hr flight.  The crew was very nice and attentive, which was a nice surprise. The quality is not worth the price, other airlines do better with attractive prices.;The food was standard and cold. The cabin crew was pleasant. Overall, the quality of product is not worth the price.
LH1376 from Frankfurt to Warsaw. Boarding went smoothly and the cabin was spotlessly clean. On this 90-minute flight, a small lunch (a wurstsalat from Lufthansa's Tasting HEIMAT business meals) was served. The portion size was a bit small for a midday flight, but you could add as many warm rolls as you wanted. The crew seemed exceptionally joyful and light-hearted. All in all very enjoyable flight.;A pleasant experience with Lufthansa airlines. The boarding process was smooth, the aircraft was tidy, the lunch was fine and the crew was joyful.
LH1185 from ZRH to FRA. This was a very smooth morning flight with an excellent crew. The flight was about half full (also in business) and boarding was fast. Even though it was a short flight of approximately 40 minutes, a small snack of muesli with fresh fruit was served, which was very tasty. The aircraft was spotlessly clean. All in all an excellent experience for such a short flight.;A pleasant experience for a short haul flight with no hassles, swift boarding, nice snack, and clean aircraft.
Just to record praise where it’s due. For some reason unknown to myself, despite flying about a hundred flights a year for years, I stupidly forgot my passport for this trip to Seoul. I managed to retrieve with Uber from home but it meant I was still at checkin just 20 mins before departure. The SAS/Lufthansa checkin staff did an amazing job and showed incredible flexibility to somehow get me onboard. Thanks a million for fantastic service which won’t be forgotten!;A pleasant experience for a short haul flight with no hassles, swift boarding, nice snack, and clean aircraft.
Unfortunately my 75 year old father forgot his ID card in Belgium so was unable to take the flight from Luxembourg yesterday. It's been non-stop stress since then trying to get him to Bulgaria with no help from Lufthansa. Thankfully we will get him here in time for Christmas through a different airline but have been told that Lufthansa considers him a no show for this trip and have now canceled his return ticket. They are willing to sell this same ticket back to us for an additional 327 euros however. ;The father forgot his ID card and was not allowed to take the flight. Lufthansa did not help us in any way.
I needed to rebook my flight because of a notification in a change in flight times, so I asked for a refund to get this done. My $580 ticket was refunded $80. I was convinced this was an error, so I spent the next month getting transferred to different customer service departments. Ultimately, here’s the reply I received: “ We would like to inform you that As per our investigation Voluntary Full refund as per Fare rules correctly processed on ticket as there was no Flight cancellation found. We realize that this may not be the response you wished but we hope that this experience will not prevent you from making your future travel plans with Lufthansa.” I will never fly with Lufthansa.;I got $80 refund on a $580 ticket. I thought it was an error  but Lufhansa did not help. I will never choose Lufthansa in future.
Keflavík to Frankfurt in Business Class in an A320neo. Business Class seating is similar to Economy but with the middle seat left vacant. Service was attentive and efficient, as we have come to expect from Lufthansa. The flight was on time. Unfortunately, most of the A320neo aircraft in the Lufthansa fleet are without WiFi and I hope the company addresses this issue soon.;The service was efficient and responsible. The flight was on time but there was no wifi available.
Frankfurt to Mumbai in Business Class on an A340-300. Lufthansa's aging A340 aircraft together with its dated Business Class product seems Stone Age compared to its competition, especially when you look at carriers such as Qatar and ANA. Lufthansa excels is in the service department - staff are efficient and warm. The food served was also very good by airline standards.;The aircraft was very old as compared to its competitors. However, the service and food was top quality.
I booked my flight 6 months ago and around 2 month ago I got the first e-Mail with the information that my flight was canceled and rescheduled. I called Lufthansa Customer service and there was a very nice man who helped me to rescheduling my flight. A month later, my flight was rescheduled twice, without letting me know, I only saw it because I checked the Lufthansa app. Then last week I got another e-Mail that my flight was canceled again, though I called the Customer Service again. First I tried 6 times, the computer hung up on my every time, then I tried it very early in the morning on the next time and I had to wait for 35 minutes until someone picked up.  The woman was not very friendly, I told her my story and she gave me a new flight and muted herself for around 5 minutes without letting me know. I was talking and asked if someone is still there etc no answer, then she unmuted herself for 2 second and was muted again. I am really disappointed.;My flight was rescheduled again and again and then finally cancelled. I called Lufthansa customer service. The call got received afer a long time. The staff was not very considerate, although I got a new flight but very disppaointed with the customer service.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Lufthansa refunded me less than 10% for having to cancel my parents' flights because of the shut down of Austria due to the vaccine resistant Covid variant. I have appealed this twice and they have told me I was given what I deserved, yet their public statement is that they ""care for the safety of their passengers"" which is evidently not true.";Lufthansa only compensated me less than 10% for having to cancel my parents' flights due to closure of Austria.
✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Berlin via Frankfurt. There is no customer service at Lufthansa. They will claim that you can rebook or have a refund of your ticket because of COVID travel changes but this is a blatant lie. The worst part was trying to get in contact with them - I do not have an international phone company so I could not call them. I spent two weeks waiting for a response to my emails - nothing. I had to have a friend in the US call, and even then they wouldn't rebook. The wanted to rebook a flight without refunding or giving me a voucher at all, and charge me over 1000$. I will never, never fly with them again, which is too bad, because the flight itself wasn't bad. They want to take your money and give you nothing for it.;Lufthansa's  customer service is poor. The worst thing was trying to contact them because I don't have access to an international phone service and couldn't reach them. They wanted to charge me over $1,000 to rebook a flight.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Before Covid I regularly flew Lufthansa. Maybe not the most easy going airline, maybe not the best food, but dependable and with loads of smaller destinations in Eastern Europe. I was pleasantly surprised. Both going to Sibiu and returning, Lufthansa out did my expectations. Checkin was fast. everywhere the QR code was checked. The lounge at München airport was good, not too full with a decent selection of food and drinks. The ground staff was nice and the air hostesses; chatty and helpful. Seating on European routes is not that good, but with flight times under 1,5 hours that's not really a problem. The food was the most pleasant surprise, with fine regional German food, presented in an attractive way. When I mentioned this to one of the cabin crew, she told me that the offerings had recently been upgraded.";The cuisine turned out to be a nice surprise. On European trips, seating isn't great, but with flight times around 1,5 hours, this isn't a big deal.
Not Verified | We booked flights with Lufthansa in February to travel over Xmas. We had 6 small flight changes, all fine. We then received an email asking us to call (a premium number) where we were told our last connecting flight had been cancelled and were offered an alternative that left before our other flight had arrived. I explained this was not an alternative and was told there was nothing they can do. I was told to cancel, which would have cost us over £2000 extra due to now booking last minute. I was hung up on 4 times by various agents (including one who just started taking other customer calls with me on the phone line). Eventually we managed to rebook with an increased travel time of 12 hours and after having spent 4 hours on the phone at 40p per minute over 3 days. The customer service is appalling. I have also complained via their email complaint line and have been told someone will get back to me 5 times in the last 4 weeks and have heard nothing.;Over our flight booking for xmas, we were informed that our last connecting flight had been canceled and given an alternate flight that would depart before our other flight arrived. Various agents hung up on me four times. The customer service is really disappointing.
"Not Verified |  We always fly United however for this trip, we were unable to use United so we booked Lufthansa. The attendants were mostly helpful. However, one attendant was cold and stoic. At the end of a long flight, we asked what carousel to go to for our luggage. The attendant said she didn't know and told us to keep moving on. Also, the online app did not work so we had to wait in a very long line in order to show our documents. When we finally got to the front, we were told we had to check our carry on luggage. One piece was ""2 pounds over"" and the other was ""4 pounds over."" I will never use this airline again.";For showing our documents, we had to wait in a very long queue because the online app didn't work. When it came to assisting us with our luggage, one of the attendants was unfriendly and stoic. I will never fly with this company again.
✅ Trip Verified |  LH827 CPH-FRA CPH check in fast. Had to walk what seemed a infinity to the Gate. Flight had a gate change. Inside the aircraft it was roasting hot. Landed in FRA on time, and bags took a long time to get out on to the luggage carousel. Lufthansa is okay for Euro Domestic trips.;Lufthansa is fine for domestic flights in Europe. our bags took a long time to get to the carousel. The temperature inside the plane was very hot.
Not Verified |  Didn’t really have any expectations before flying, especially in covid times but was reasonably pleased with Lufthansa. Outbound flight from BHX to FRA was half full so had lots of spare seats. A bottle of water was provided with some chocolates. FRA to SEA was 60% full so we were able to move around the cabin and find seats with more space. The crew were really friendly and when serving drinks told us to have two as they weren’t coming back for a while. The food was standard ok. The return flights were a lot fuller and the crew came round less often but this wasn’t a problem given it was a night flight. My only gripe is the IFE system on the a333. There were two different systems - one that was similar to a tablet and one that was a sort of tv. The former was fine but the latter was so laggy that you touched the screen and it choose a different option. This meant passengers were poking the screen meaning that those sat in front of them were disturbed. I do wonder whether covid has been used to reign back the food and drink options;Lufthansa's  experience was quite pleasing. The crew were friendly and food was good. The only dispapointing thing was the IFE system.
Not Verified |  I was sitting at the back of the aircraft. They ran out of bread before they got to me. Lunch was a sub-par vegetarian snack wrap with cheese. Worst part is they lost my luggage. No word 24h after my flight. When I called the line they told me they weren’t sure were my luggage was but that it might still be in Frankfurt. I was offered no type of compensation even though I was forced to purchase new clothes so that I could go to work. I’m no longer in Toronto and have no idea when I will receive my luggage.;Lunch was a mediocre vegetarian snack wrap stuffed with cheese. Worst of all, they misplaced my luggage. I'm no longer in Toronto and have no idea when I'll be able to retrieve it.
✅ Trip Verified |  I haven't received my baggage at all during 2 days! Since I arrived from Frankfurt there were 3 flights with same destination but for some reason my luggage was not in any of these flights. I had all my stuff there that i need on daily basis, I spend money to buy new, was not able to work and seems company doesn't care at all for passengers and what they are going to do without their stuff. As well its impossible to contact Lufthansa as no one pick up phone as well no one reply to emails. I hope that i will receive my baggage at least, what might not be the case. Highly do not recommend this company!;I haven't received my luggage. Since I am in Frankfurt, there have been flights with the same destination, but my luggage was not on any of them. Lufthansa is unable to answer the phone or respond to emails. I do not recommend lufthansa.
✅ Trip Verified |  Great flight at all. Ground staff in Frankfurt was unfriendly at checkin. Lounge was great. Service in the flight was amazing! Seats could be more spacious and more private like other airline business class seats. But all in all, good Job Lufthansa.;The check-in staff was unfriendly. The lounge and flight service was fantastic. Seats could be improved.
✅ Trip Verified |  Very bad experience on this flight to Mexico City. No Gin-Tonic on board. Sitting with my wife in the middle row, they were not able to serve dinner at the same time. I got my menu when my wife had finished hers. The presentation of my main meal was disgusting. When asking the flight attendant what happened she just explained that there was a problem when charging the food at the airport. They didn’t show me the wine bottle but just bring you a glass of wine.;The meal was not served at the same time. There is no Gin-Tonic on board. The presentation of my main meal was nauseating. An extremely bad experience!
"✅ Trip Verified | Worst business class experience ever. Negative - Inept, arrogant inflight service. Clumsy at times (one of the other passengers got soaked in red wine by a clumsy flight attendant), utterly clueless mostly (they ignored me for hours, ""forgetting"" to serve food drink or water) Flight attendants and other staff have difficulties restraining their contempt for the customers. Glossy menus but hardly any items on the menu available. Boarding experience is a mess. Staff takes pleasure in giving business class customers a hard time. Outdated business class cabin without any privacy or aisle access Not enough wash rooms in the cabin. Long queues throughout the flight. Positive Lounges are stylish (food could be better in LHR, lounge in FRA is fine). Flights were on time. No luggage was lost. Comfortable seat with ample leg room, had a good night’s sleep.";Poor business class experience. In-flight service is inept and condescending. Old-fashioned business class cabin with little privacy or aisle access. Throughout the flight, there were long lines for the restroom. The advantages include an on-time flight, no luggage issues, and a comfy seat.
✅ Trip Verified |  Cabin was not cleaned. Garbage from previous flight left in the seat net. Unfriendly personnel (gentleman in the business desk) and bad boarding organizations, eg. caling priority passengers but not letting them in because they have another boarding group. ;The cabin had not been cleaned. Garbage from the prior flight was there in the seat. Unfriendly staff at the business counter and poor boarding arrangements.
Not Verified |  I have had better experience in an economy class on many airlines than Business Class on this airline. Horrible service, worst food and incredibly unfriendly. The flight attendant on my side was picking and choosing who he wanted to give his attention to and I was not one of them. He gave out 4 hygiene utility bags to people in front of me but not to me. I asked if I could have some fruit as I was going to the washroom and he told me that he didn't have any fruit to offer but on my way back to my seat I noticed that couple on the first row had a bowl of fruit in front of them.  The entertainment was not good either. I couldn't wait to get off the plane. I was not expecting his from a German company. Never flying them again.;Horrible service, terrible food, and quite hostile attitude. It seemed the flight attendant was choosing who he wanted to pay attention to. I was eager to get off the plane. I'll never fly them again. The entertainment was also subpar.
✅ Trip Verified |  Some of the passengers didn’t wear the protective mask: the staff didn’t care much for that. Meal service is very basic. For dinner they only offered one option and it was vegetarian. No second option.  During the flight they offered only water: no crackers, no fruit, no sandwiches. Seats are cramped and toilets were dirty. I cannot recommend this airline.;Passengers' seats are congested, and the restrooms are filthy. There is only one vegetarian option for dinner. Some guests did not wear the protective mask and the staff did not appear to care about it.
✅ Trip Verified | Flight departed late, causing me to miss my connecting flight. At Frankfurt, I was sent to a different terminal to talk to customer service, meaning I had to go through security twice before being issued a new boarding pass for a flight five hours later. The legroom is also extremely small for a transatlantic flight - just a regular-sized backpack placed under the seat in front of me meant that I had no space for my legs in a 10-hour flight, and I was also brushing against the person sitting next to me the whole flight even though I'm extremely thin. The food was disgusting. The cabin and ground staff were all very pleasant and helpful, which was the only positive thing about my experience flying with Lufthansa.;The flight was late, the food was awful, and there was very little legroom in the cabin. The only positive aspect of the flight was the pleasant and helpful staff.
✅ Trip Verified |  We paid extra for the choice to select our seats and on two different occasions, they were erased from record. After a total 14 hours of time on hold/talking with customer service we finally were able to confirm (we hoped) that our seats were together and where we selected them/paid extra for. The communication with Lufthansa and their partner airlines were horrible. Lack of information was shared, false details were relayed to us. We finally boarded our overnight flight from Denver to Frankfurt, but the AC was broken and it was 86 degrees in the cabin. They made no effort to rectify the horrible overnight (9 hour) flying experience.  My baggage was lost in Italy and the process for getting it back was long and stressful. Finally after 6 days, while calling to confirm 5x a day I was able to get my work equipment back.  I've tried to contact Customer Relations, but as of today it's been 25 days without a response from them. ;Lufthansa and their partner airlines provided terrible customer service. There was a lack of information shared, and we were given misleading information. My luggage was misplaced in Italy, and the recovery process was lengthy and frustrating.
✅ Trip Verified |  After one month rest from the previous experience I decided to give LH a second try and flew from FRA to KBP this week. Last time it was from Munich. My feeling is that I was flying two different airlines then and now. Online check in worked well and produced a mobile boarding pass. Automated bag drop at FRA took 3 minutes and was flawless with nice staff on help if you need it. Check in counter (I had to correct some info) gave me all required help and with smile. At the gate everything was in perfect order and well communicated. Onboard crew were cheerful and served in a very professional manner. I purchased a sandwich which was good quality and not overpriced. Wifi worked with no internet access (strange kind of service, but luckily my card was not charged). Flight was on schedule both out and in. Disembarkation was fast. Bag on the belt in 5 minutes. Miles on the account next morning. What else would one want?;The online check-in process went smoothly and issued a mobile boarding permit. The onboard crew was cheery and professional. Wifi operated even when there was no internet connection. The flight and luggage arrived on schedule.
✅ Trip Verified |  A320neo, 4.30h flight without entertainment, no seat adjustment possible, no usb charger, no wifi, the catering was an inadequate old wrap, crew more or less in a bad mood. Spending almost 5 hours on a night-flight in an upright position without blanket, pillow, or service? ;The flight was without entertainment, comfort, good service, and amenities.
✅ Trip Verified |  I used to enjoy the food served on Lufthansa business class flights. On short flights it were often just a few bites very nicely presented which gave you the feeling to be a well treated guest by them (and you also always paid the high price for it). On the most recent short haul flights I took with Lufthansa I was shocked the food served in business class has been downgraded while ticket prices are as high or even higher as ever before. The food served on my business class flights were uninspired tasteless sandwiches. They looked similar to the sandwiches Lufthansa used to serve in Economy until a few months ago. If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. It’s an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average. If this is the new Lufthansa I may as well consider flying low cost for my next flights and just pay for food sold on board. It would be a massive saving;Lufthansa's business class meals has been downgraded. The sandwiches appeared similar to those distributed to Economy.It is better to travel low-cost for my next flight and only pay for meals sold on board.
✅ Trip Verified |  HEL-FRA-GRU 2nd September, GRU-FRA-HEL 19th October. Flights were on time. Could find 2-3 movies politically incorrect enough to be worth checking.  No meal HEL_FRA, inedible dinner. All flights had dozens of maskless people, for example 4 right in front of me. Crew remained passive in this regard, even after pointing this out. In fact, on both 747 legs, one of them had an unfitting mask not covering his nose. Preflight nobody could be contacted by phone. Had I known how reckless Lufthansa is in regard to covid pandemic, I would have canceled my flights. For those who do not care, bring your own food. 11 hours is a long time without a meal.;During covid pandemic, Lufthansa is negligent. Every flight featured scores of maskless passengers, including four directly in front of me. 11 hours without a meal is a long time. Nobody could be reached by phone prior to the trip.
✅ Trip Verified |  They give pasta (macaroni) for meal both on the flight to go Los Angeles and going back. Also I have connected flight from Ankara to Munich they give nothing even water. I had never experience like this. also they don’t want to give me second beer, hostess are rude and dour. ;They serve pasta as food on both flights to and from Los Angeles. Also, they did not even distribute water, and the hostess is unpleasant and depressing.
Not Verified | Munich to Barcelona. The flight attendants did not help us at all and they were the opposite to resourceful. The person who was supposed to help us locate our luggage didn’t even attempt to solve the problem that we had. She just kept ignoring our problems. Moreover, the flight was more than an our late without any type of explanation. This airline is just incompetent and not resourceful to say the least.;This airline is inept and resourceless. The staff who was meant to assist us in locating our bags made no attempt to address our problem. The flight was more than an hour delayed.
✅ Trip Verified |  Took flight from Frankfurt to Mumbai last week. Food was pathetic, on the name of covid and less crew. No fresh snacks were served or nonveg food was given, failed to understand the reason behind it. No much options in food in spite of charging high. Seats were ok but little congested cabin for long journey. Lots of scope in improvements.;The food was appalling. There were no fresh snacks or nonveg meals supplied. The seats were fine. There is a lot of room for improvement.
✅ Trip Verified | Extremely disappointing. At gate they wanted Vax info even though UAL had uploaded to itinerary. On boarding no welcome beverage or real welcome. No menu provided. Table setting consisted of a cloth tossed at our table. Meager amenity pack. Mediocre food. Not very comfortable bed. 1970's coach with a flat bed.;The bed was like a flat-bed coach from the 1970s. Awful amenity package. Disappointing experience.
✅ Trip Verified | As always with Lufthansa I had no problem with this flight. The flights were on time and planes were clean. I still don't like to fly with mask on my face, hope this end soon.;on time flights and tidy aircraft was a good experience.
✅ Trip Verified |  I had booked Stuttgart to Budapest via Munich. That's what I got and LH initially confirmed. On check in, the flight from STR to MUC had been cancelled and I was rebooked to fly through FRA (what I wanted to avoid). Flight STR to FRA was delayed by more than 45 min, I only made the connection in FRA because the gate was just across and because also FRA to BUD was delayed. My luggage, though, didn't catch the flight and was only delivered during the night. ;The Lufthansa flight from Stuttgart to Budapest was more than 45 minutes late. My luggage was left there and was delivered late at night.
✅ Trip Verified |  Boeing 737-8 business class is excellent. Seats are comfortable, love the storage area for window seats in Business Class. Extremely competent and friendly flight attendants attending every need throughout the flight. This includes disassembling a seat to recover my lost glasses - not a simple task for complex full recline seats in Business class. Above average meals. Only complaint was that the USB port did not have enough power to charge my iPad or even keep it from discharging (albeit slowly).;The business class on the Boeing 737-8 is fantastic. Flight attendants are very competent and polite and cater to every need throughout the flight. Meals are above ordinary.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Moscow to Newark via Frankfurt. Flight from Moscow to Frankfurt. At the check-in counter they the rep said that I have to pay for my luggage even though, it was paid at the time of the ticket purchasing. The shift supervisor stated that their computer does not reflect my luggage was prepaid and that I have to go to the company cashier window and get some kind of proof that this is the case. Finally, after standing in line to see the cashier I managed to get the required number that proves my luggage was prepaid. Why are you asking your customers to prove that they paid for the luggage? Is booking number should be enough to see the whole info? Flight from Frankfurt to Newark my food was horrible. The flight attendants are rude. During meal time when I was trying to eat and answered her question about my choice of drink she asked me to put on my mask for the reason. ""because you are talking to me"".";Even though my luggage was paid for, the check-in agent insisted that I pay for it. According to the supervisor, their computer does not show that my luggage was pre-paid. When I was trying to eat and answering her inquiry about my drink of choice, she requested me to put on my mask.
✅ Trip Verified |  I'll never fly LH again after this trip. Transatlantic service is abysmal: only 1 drink service, with beer/wine being the sole alcoholic offering, then nothing but water available till breakfast, which consists of a tiny fruit salad and stale muffin. As for dinner, my pasta was inedible. European flights only offer free water. Even bags on transatlantic flights are now charged. Inflight TV set hardly worked and barely anything worth watching. I used to look forward to flying LH, now I'll avoid them like the plague.;After this journey, I'll never fly LH again. Only one drink service is provided, with beer/wine being the only alcoholic option. Bags are now taxed as well. The in-flight TV system was hardly functional.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I traveled on a return itinerary from France to Japan with my family of 4. On the outbound flights their cabin crew lost some cabin baggage that they took off us; for storage elsewhere on the plane. On leaving the plane, they said that they would follow up and contact me but I heard nothing. Then they insisted that I fill out an online customer service form - still nothing. The meal service on their long haul flights has been downgraded significantly. I have noted the deteriorating service levels at Lufthansa, in multiple ways. Can Lufthansa still be called them a 5-Star airline? I don't think so.";Is Lufthansa still a five-star airline? No, I don't believe so. The food and service on their long-haul flights has been drastically reduced. Their cabin crew misplaced some cabin bags that they had taken from us.
✅ Trip Verified |  The hard product has for several years been painfully outdated. What was surprising this time around was the nose-dive the soft product has taken, all under the pandemic excuse. The amenity kits were underwhelming. It was explained to me, that, as this was a day flight, there was no reason for the kits to contain earplugs and eye masks. For the same reason, there were no pajamas offered. One alcohol wipe was given to each passenger upon boarding and this seemed to have taken care of all hygiene concerns, as I did not see the bathroom cleaned during the flight. C-class bathrooms contained no amenities. Beverage service was the only thing that seemed to be alright. Food was poorly presented and of a sub-par quality. No snacks were offered between meals, nor were any (or any water) readily available at the galley. No water runs between the meal services. Crew were disengaged, slow, and didn't seem to care much.;For several years, the hard product has been terribly out of date. The soft product has plummeted as a result of the epidemic. The only thing that seemed to be going well was the beverage service. The crew was disconnected, slow, and uninterested.
✅ Trip Verified |  I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt to Berlin, which I missed due to the immigration system there. Even after telling the authorities that my Berlin flight has started the boarding, they remained unhelpful. After missing my flight, I went to Lufthansa Service center, they booked me on the next flight which was after 3 hours and my ticket was in the waiting list. After 3 hrs, they told me that they couldn’t confirm my ticket and can put me on the next flight which again is not confirmed. I kept explaining that the delay is not even my fault but that of the immigration. They said everybody is suffering, they can’t do anything. They were very unsupportive. In the end, I had to first fly to Munich and then to Berlin. I had a very unpleasant journey with Lufthansa this time. ;This time, I had an extremely awful journey with Lufthansa. I continued repeating that my missed flight was responsibility of immigration. The staff were completely unhelpful. 
✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Malta return in July. Service has decreased.  There are no more free drinks and food on European flights in Economy except a small bottle of water and a tiny piece of chocolate. You have to pay for everything else. Nevertheless prices are on a high level. Apart from rather poor service the flight was comfortable with a good crew. A big plus was that the crew took care of Covid-19 rules. I still recommend Lufthansa, but don´t expect too much.;Lufthansa no longer provides complimentary drinks and snacks in Economy class. Except for water and a small piece of chocolate, everything else was paid. Aside from the bad service, the crew was pleasant and followed Covid-19 regulations.
✅ Trip Verified |  They damaged my bag, I reported the damage, but nobody contacted me even after a month. Old plane (no entertainment, no screens, no AUX plugs for music). Phone customer service is the worst, and when they answer they don't help me. No flexibility when it comes to baggage weight (I cannot really complain about since these are the regulations). I usually weigh everything so it is not a problem for me, but come on try to be good at one thing!;They broke my bag, and I reported it, but no response for a month. Old plane, no entertainment, no screens, no music AUX connections. There is no room for negotiation when it comes to baggage weight.
✅ Trip Verified |  Out of my flights only 1 was on time (others 30min to 1,5 hours late). For the long flight my food was bad and my entertainment system was unusable (the touch screen is made in the 2000s I guess). The lag is unreal and it restarts every few touches I make.  My last flight to Mexico was canceled without any notify. And the company is refusing to take any responsibility by responding with meaningless mail, and ignoring after I send them another one. ;Only one of my flights was on time. The food was terrible, and entertainment system was useless. My previous flight to Mexico was canceled with no prior notice.
✅ Trip Verified |  48 hours before flying, LH requested that we fill up on internet a survey about our Covid status, uploading our double vaccination status. So did we. The day before we received an email denying the validity of our surveys, and adding a lot of stress. At the gate everything was double checked, and was OK. Suddenly a boss decided that passenger documentation had to be checked again (10 mn before boarding time). No explanation was given. Only 2 employees were allocated to that job, and 3 remained smiling and chatting. When more than 50 % of the pax were queuing for this 2nd check, boarding was announced, and panic was installed. Lh does not seem to realize that Covid is already stressing by itself, and that one of the airline duty is to low down the level of stress.;An online survey regarding our Covid status was required before flight. Everything was double verified at the gate.When more than half of the passengers were in line for the second check, boarding was announced, creating panic. Lh appears to be unaware that Covid is already stressed, and that one of the airline's responsibilities is to reduce further stress.
✅ Trip Verified |  I have had terrible experience exchanging and then seeking refund for Lufthansa's business flexible tickets. Business flexible is a joke. It's neither flexible nor fully refundable. They have a really convoluted system.;Lufthansa's flexible business tickets are a scam. Their system is neither flexible nor entirely refundable.
✅ Trip Verified |  After the online checkin was completed by my side on time, I never received any QR code for the boarding pass and upon arrival to the airport, I had to wait in an excessively long queue. Whilst I had no baggage (checkin completed as aforementioned) for 1 hour in order to receive boarding pass. I am a regular flyer from HH to ATH and never had to go through such trouble to fly in the midst of the pandemic, as I always present my documents before flying. ;My online check-in was completed on time, however I never received a QR code for my boarding pass, and when I arrived, I had to wait in a very long line.
✅ Trip Verified | Our luggage delivery was delayed 60 hrs, after it was not boarded on the connecting flight. Reimbursement of essential items expenses was adequate. Needless to say that inconvenience was quite significant. On the return leg, our flight from FRA to FCO was cancelled, but without explanation. Only much later we learnt this was due to the Italian air controllers strike. Would have been good to explain it beforehand in Lufthansa's notification emails, so to reduce concern. Trying to talk with someone at the Service Center proved impossible in those days;Our luggage was delayed for 60 hours. The reimbursement for necessary materials was adequate. The communication with service center was not possible.
✅ Trip Verified |  Booking online for your flight, if there are no issues/canceling/rebooking is easy. Their service on the plane itself is OK. However, Lufthansa does not allow rebooking online if your flight gets cancelled or there are complications due to coronavirus. Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online. To rebook, you need to call their call service, which is a nightmare. I tried to rebook 3 times. First time I was on hold for about an hour. Then, I explained the situation, was put on hold, and after 1 hour of waiting was disconnected from the line. This same thing happened 3 times. The customer service is extremely slow and inefficient.;If your flight is canceled or there are issues owing to a coronavirus, Lufthansa does not allow online rebooking. Other airlines accept refunds, but their customer care department denies them. Customer service is bad in terms of efficiency.
✅ Trip Verified |  This has to be the worst experience I have ever had with an airline and I have held several status with airlines over the years. My wife and I bought tickets for a 10 Day trip to Scotland this year in June to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We originally booked with British Airways. Due to the COVID 19 outbreaks, the trip was canceled by the travel company. British Airways promptly refund our money because we cannot get into the country. The trip company off to rebook us again in August, and because of limited routes, we booked the second air trip with Lufthansa instead. Unfortunately, Scotland did not open this August either. I made numerous attempts to contact Customer Service at Lufthansa, but to no avail. I was force to cancel my tickets online, but they only refunded a small portion of the taxes despite the fact they cannot even take me to Scotland.  I am currently out over $7,000 dollars because these were business class tickets that we saved up to purchase. I will never take this airline again. ;This year, my wife and I purchased tickets for a 10-day trip to Scotland in June. The travel firm canceled the vacation due to the COVID 19 outbreaks. I'm currently losing more than $7,000 because these were business class tickets that we saved up for.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Had two very pleasant flights with Lufthansa. Correct times and 2x bottles of water on the flight with a chocolate. Water should be given on all flights since you can't bring your own. They also still announce the take-off with ""ladies and gentlemen"" like it should be.";A pleasant experience. Timely flights and two bottles of water and a chocolate. Staff very polite.
✅ Trip Verified |  Paying for Business Saver Class on Lufthansa is a waste of money. 2 weeks before the flight I requested to change the date of the outgoing flight to the day before. It is sold to you that this is possible on the Business Saver Class, with the extra price to be covered by you. Rang up Lufthansa, they wanted to charge me €276 euro as they had no Business Saver seats available, so Business ++ was the only option. I said I would be happy to downgrade to a regular seat, they replied that you can downgrade at the airport, not on the phone, and then tried to get me to pay the €276. Just before I paid i asked will i receive the difference in fair price between the regular class and the business Class already paid. No was the answer.;Paying for Lufthansa's Business Saver Class is a waste of money. I sought a change in the departure date two weeks before the travel and downgrade the seat to regular.  They refused to reimburse for the difference in fair pricing between normal class and business class.
Not Verified |  This review is not about my last flight but about the terrible customer service I have experienced for more than a year. I tried booking flights 4 times and they cancelled them on me over and over and it takes more than 6 months to reimburse. My last purchase dates of Jan 31st for a flight in April that was cancelled. I am still waiting for the money. Their phone customer service is terrible. They don't even pick up. It's embarrassing.;Southwest Airlines' customer service has been appalling. They repeatedly cancelled flights, and it takes more than 6 months to get reimbursed. Their phone customer service is poor.
✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Beirut via Frankfurt. I called Lufthansa and their answering service is so bad. I was on hold for over an hour trying to cancel my return flight due to an emergency. It is very frustrating traveling inbound where they cancel our flight and instead of 4 hours layover we ended up waiting 11 hours and no compensation. This is the worst airline. No consideration for family traveling with kids. As of now I can't cancel my trip and online service doesn't allow you to do so. We should have more reliable service when you have an emergency.;I spent almost an hour on hold trying to cancel my return flight due to an emergency. we had to wait 11 hours with no reimbursement. I can't cancel my flight online, customer service is awful.
✅ Trip Verified |  In 2020, when every other airline was trying to cheat me, Lufthansa went above and beyond and gave me even better terms than my contract entitled me too. They were also rather gracious when I showed up with oversized luggage, and did not charge me extra, although they could have. Of all the airlines I've been flying with, this is the one one that I have no complaints about.;This is the only airline I've travelled with that I have no issues about. They did not charge me for excessive luggage.
✅ Trip Verified |  Impossible to join them on the phone. Waiting multiple times more than one hour and nobody is answering, the call simply stopped by itself. The lady at the airport wasn't offering any option except than to call again the customer service (which both cost money and doesn't answer).;The call customer service is poor. I had to wait many times for more than an hour.
✅ Trip Verified |  Disappointing service on the Transatlantic leg, pasta and beer/wine, no liquor, and for the rest of that flight only water was available. From Germany to Turkey, a bottle of water and nothing else. Won't look forward to flying LH ever again.;Inadequate service. spaghetti and beer/wine, no liquor, and only water for the rest of the journey. I will never fly LH anymore.
✅ Trip Verified |  Very mediocre hard and soft product for price paid. No choices for food were available by they time the got to me despite half the cabin being upgraded and getting their choice. I had to remind staff multiple times to get service like refills. Ground service also was unaware of latest covid rules for destination wasting about 30 minutes of my time. I was disappointed by the dirtiness of my seat departing from Vancouver. ;For the money spent, this is a really mediocre hard and soft product. limited food options. Ground staff was unaware of the covid regulations.
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Online portal is horrible and feels dated. Not something from a giant airline. Could not check in online or at my first gate and was told I would have to go through security at Seattle to go out and print my ticket. Booth was almost empty, one nice employee helped me but then I risked missing my flight. Because of this, I had a terrible seat as well during the pandemic. Avoid at all costs. Never flying with them again.;Worst airline in history. I was unable to check in online or at my first gate. Got a terrible seat. I would avoid this airline at every cost.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to lower traffic, I was hoping that connection in FRA was going to be stress less. I was wrong. Despite a lot of empty fingers, flight from MRS was parked in a remote position. Disembarking was very slow due to COVID, bus was late, and it took hours to arrive at T ""A"" and we nearly missed a 1h15 connection.";Because of COVID, disembarking was very delayed and so was the bus and we almost missed a 1h15 connection.
Not Verified |  This flight was a disaster. We had our departure as 6pm july7, and boarding at 5.10pm. When we start boarding it was 7, and we waited one and half hours in the airplane and then told the airplane has issues and we have to go back to gate. We were at the gate at 8.30pm and waited till 10pm at the gate and we are only given 5-6 jellybeans and a very small pack of cheese. It was horrible and then they started to board at 11pm and we finally take the departure at 12.40 am.  We had 6.40 hours of delay and then once we go to Frankfurt, they told us they will handle connection flights, which they literally put everyone on the waitlist. We had transit visa issues and we cannot wait after 12 hours in Germany, they finally gave us a flight at 9pm. We waited for another 6 hours in Frankfurt airport.  Horrible horrible experience and they don’t even care. ;This flight experience was a complete failure. 5-6 jellybeans and a small pack of cheese was served. We were delayed for 6.40 hours, missing connection flights, airline put everyone on the waiting.
✅ Verified Review |  Short flight on Lufthansa Business Class from Frankfurt to Berlin Tegel. The Lufthansa lounge was nice and I really enjoyed the shower after a long haul flight from BKK. Basic but delicious food, nice staff. Boarding was well organized with priority boarding and separate entrance for Business Class passengers. Service was great as usual on Lufthansa.;short flight, comfortable lounge, nice boarding, food and service. Appreciating experience.
✅ Verified Review |  On my last flight in Lufthansa  Business Class three weeks ago, they provided real cotton napkins with the meal, but this time it was a paper napkin. Feels somewhat cheap for a premium product. The rest of the trip was as good as usual in this intra-Europe Business Class. As the price was ok, no complaints.;paper napkins seem cheap for a premeium product. Overall, the journey was nice.
✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Rome. The biz lounge at Frankfurt is quite nice but was so busy and overcrowded. Boarding did not offer priority to biz class or Star Gold which was disappointing. Aircraft was fine, very clean and bright, but seats are just coach class layout with center seat left empty - larger than British Airways on my flight to Frankfurt. Drinks and food served 30 mins after departure and very nice for mid morning flight. Attendants very charming and seemed friendly enough. Overall good onboard experience but needs improvement in Frankfurt.;Frankfurt lounge was good was overly crowded. Aircraft was nice and tidy. Cabin crew quite friendly. A good experience overall.
✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Munich. The 2-2-2 business class seat configuration is for sure a bad choice for Lufthansa. Most of Lufthansa competitors have direct aisle access seat configuration (1-2-1). Anyway the seat was comfortable and I could sleep well. The flight attendants were very efficient and professional, Food was decent, nothing spectacular. Flight entertainment seemed a bit old.;Lufthansa's 2-2-2 business class seat layout was undoubtedly a poor choice. The flight attendants were courteous and professional. The food was adequate. Flight entertainment appeared to be outdated.
✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Frankfurt on 747-8 and Frankfurt to San Francisco on A380 in Business Class. Lufthansa's Business Class product is looking jaded and mediocre and no longer feels like a premium experience. A reason is the terrible seat layout with little privacy and the cabin feels and looks crowded. The B747 seats are slightly more comfortable than the A380 with better space around the seats. The onboard service is good, the flight attendants well-trained and efficient. The wifi service was highly unreliable and the $20+ fee seems a rip-off when there are so many breaks in service. The business Lounges in FRA were crowded, and boarding was botched with broken lines and no clear direction.;Lufthansa's Business Class product appears stale and substandard. The seat layout is poor and the cabin is congested. The wifi connectivity was unstable. The service and staff were nice.
✅ Verified Review | Between Christmas and New Year I was flying Munich to Faro with Lufthansa. The flight takes about 3 hours on an A320. This aircraft does not have any special business class seats, but the central seat is always free for your comfort. The staff were friendly and first you got something to drink, then a light meal (we started at about 2 p.m.). Later on some more drinks, as you like. When checking in or before you can download your e-journal but also during flight you got some papers and/or journals. The aircraft was in time at the destination and the lounge in Munich (new satellite terminal) was good. You got drinks, wine, coffee, spirits warm and cold meals, newspapers, free Wi-Fi etc.;There are no business class seats on Lufthansa A320s. The staff were quite courteous. Free Wi-Fi, newspapers, hot and cold lunches, free drinks, and journals are available to all visitors.
✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Frankfurt. Unfortunately we were delayed by nearly 3 hours owing to a late aircraft change and weather.The flight itself was good with a substantial breakfast served by a particularly friendly and helpful pursar who could not do enough for us. Even before landing he informed us that we had been rebooked on a another flight and Lufthansa provided a smooth transfer at Frankfurt.;Due to weather conditions, our flight from Manchester to Frankfurt was delayed by approximately 3 hours. We were rebooked on another aircraft, and Lufthansa handled the transfer with ease in Frankfurt.
✅ Verified Review | Great experience on Lufthansa for both Amsterdam to Frankfurt (50min flight) and Frankfurt to Singapore (12h flight). Cabin crew very attentive, good selection of amenities on Lufthansa Y+ class. The meals were all very tasty, I ordered low fat meals and was impressed. German sparkling wine was on demand and available all throughout the long haul flight. I walked the whole lenght of the lower deck cabin and it is imprepssive how spacious is the A380. Even with the 3-4-3 config in Y a man could walk through the aisles without bumping into a shoulder of those seated. That plane is just a marvel. Very good experience.;Excellent service on Lufthansa. The cabin service was very helpful, and there was an excellent assortment of amenities on the Y+ class. German sparkling wine was in high demand and readily available during the long journey.
✅ Verified Review |  Athens to Manchester via Frankfurt. Despite a 2 hour stopover in Frankfurt we were on the same plane with the same crew for both sectors. The crew were outstanding and particularly the purser who looked after us extremely well. The breakfast and lunch served were delicious. On time flights and prompt luggage delivery ensured this was a flawless journey.;The flight was fantastic. Timely arrival and luggage delivery ensured a smooth journey. The employees on board and food were exceptional.
✅ Verified Review |  Ankara to Munich on Lufthansa. I have been a fan of Lufthansa for many years but this flight rocked my confidence in them. Following a smooth check-in we proceeded to the lounge which was sweltering hot and had a very poor selection of food and no cold drinks. The departure was delayed due to late arrival of inbound aircraft and further delayed due to late boarding. However, there was no explanation for the reasons of delay or an apology from the cockpit. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept. It was the European business class configuration with the middle seat of economy style seating left vacant. The FA's were friendly and efficient which was the only redeeming feature of this journey. The food was below acceptable for Business Class and a huge letdown for LH. As expected we were late arriving in Munich and it took over 1 hour from the time we reached our gate for the bags to be delivered. Aside from the FA's, this flight was well below expectations especially considering the price paid.;The Lufthansa flight from Ankara to Munich fell far short of expectations. The only redeeming feature of this experience was the friendly and efficient FAs. The lounge was blistering hot, with a limited menu and no cold drinks.
"✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Dubai. I have travelled recently with many airlines to Europe but Lufthansa is the best among them, very polite and helpful staff. We were travelling with Economy class with Asian Veg Meal plan and I have never had such good and tasty Indian food on an airline,. Good collection of Indian (Hindi) entertainment. Very clean and comfortable flight. Thanks Lufthansa you set new parameters of hospitality.
";Lufthansa is the best, with very friendly and helpful crew. delicious Indian food on an airplane. An excellent assortment of Indian entertainment. 
✅ Verified Review |  Flew from Frankfurt to London Heathrow. Lufthansa performed really well on this trip. Without any compromise, you get the premium features shown in the advertising at a constant level. Queueless Check-In, priority lane at security, great lounge experience, priority boarding, meal-service and a great crew made it an easy way to travel. They no longer distribute pre-departure printed magazines and papers. But there is a download option with a pretty good selection. Remember to do the download, when you are connected via Wifi for not using your mobile data.;the excellent lounge experience, priority boarding, dinner service, and a fantastic crew made the journey convenient. there is a download option for magzines and papers with a decent selection. excellent job Lufthansa!
✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Cairo via Frankfurt. After a delay of more than an hour in Amsterdam, I missed my transit flight from Frankfurt to Cairo. They did book me on another flight, but did not have a priority line for ticket printing so I almost missed my second flight as well while waiting in line. Fortunately the other flight did have a delay, all of this was greeted by the Lufthansa staff with a cold attitude and no one trying to be helpful to fix the problems the company itself was the cause of.;My transit flight was missed due to delay. Lufthansa employees greeted customers in a cold manner. They did book me on another flight, but there was no priority line for printing tickets.
✅ Verified Review |  Bremen to Bologna via Frankfurt. I often fly Lufthansa and it has never disappointed me. The aircraft were clean, both the crew and the ground service were excellent and overall the flights were very enjoyable. Lufthansa is more expensive than other airlines, but it is definitely worth it. I highly recommend this airline.;Lufthansa flights were really pleasant, with outstanding ground service. The airline is expensive, but it is well worth the extra money. i recommend this airline.
✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Singapore. Flight lived up to expectiation. Good food and service although its a packed full flight. Details and sincerity of the flight attendants excellent. A380 itself is a great plane, but Lufthansa could do something better with the seat privacy and seat comfort.;the food and service are excellent. The flight attendants were very sincere. However, Lufthansa might improve seat privacy and comfort.
✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Frankfurt. I travelled with 2 other colleagues, of whom only one had frequent flyer status with Lufthansa. We checked in through priority channel which was no problem. Quick check-in procedure at the desk. I had some issues checking in online on the Lufthansa website, which I found very annoying. An online-form where I had to fill in my visa details for China got stalled. But things where quickly sorted out by the check-in attendant. Priority boarding with my colleague was not issue, as we travelled as one ground. Nice aircraft, with nice leather seats. Yet, these seats where a firm and offered little side support. As a result you shift sideways in your seat when the pilot takes quick short turns while taxiing. Good knee and leg space. On the flight a very tasty cake was served by friendly flights attendants. Overall it was a good first-time impression for me with Lufthansa.;Check-in was simple at the front desk, and there were no complications with internet booking. The seats on board were quite firm with little side support, causing you to shift in your position when the pilot made turns. A nice impression overall.
✅ Verified Review |  New York JFK to Frankfurt. I love Lufthansa for their business class product.  Upon check in althought its quick and efficient, the check in staff was not outstanding. Lounge food is amazing this time unlike last time. Seat is not the best I would say, it has less privacy and is not that comfortable. One flight attendant was the highlight of everything.;"The lounge food is fantastic this time. I wouldn't say the seat is the best; its privacy and comfort needs improvement."
✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Bombay via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. For the ATL to FRA segment we were upgraded to the First Class cabin albeit the service was Business Class. The seat made all the difference although on this A330 the First Class cabin together with the restroom are not nearly as deluxe as those on the A380. The flight departed on time and onboard service was solid and reliable. For the FRA-BOM segment we were on the upper deck Business Class section of a new B747-8. Lufthansa has dropped the ball in the manner it has configured its new Business Class seats. They are narrow and angled towards your co-passenger in the row - a disaster that could have been avoided if Lufthansa hadn't gone cheap. By way of comparison, ANA's Business Class seat is the gold standard. Despite this disappointment, Lufthansa's reliability, predictability and vast flight network are its strengths.;Lufthansa has messed up the configuration of its new Business Class seats. They're narrow and inclined towards your rowmate, a calamity that could have been prevented. The onboard service on this A330 was consistent and reliable.
✅ Verified Review | Brussels to Stockholm via Frankfurt. Lufthansa remains one of my favorite carriers, partly because of the excellent staff and pilots (honestly it's a pleasure to fly with them) and partly because of their nice fleet of aircraft and legroom. I've flown with them this year on transcontinental and European flights and they still are able to stand out from other carriers I have used in the past.;Lufthansa is one of my favorite airlines, partly because of the wonderful personnel. I've flown with them this year, and they continue to stand out as compared with its competitors.
✅ Verified Review |  Lufthansa has been on strike recently. My flight from Birmingham to Munich was cancelled and I was slightly stressed, because I had to get back. Upon calling Lufthansa, they suggested that I could take a later flight on that day. As this was not possible, I asked them if they could book me a flight with British Airways from Heathrow. I did not expect this to be possible, as I was calling them some 6 hours before the flight (from LHR) and the ticket costing around 5x as much as my economy light ticket on the LH flight. I got a new ticket some 30 seconds later and everything has been confirmed. If you follow their procedures, Lufthansa will get the job done.;My flight from Birmingham to Munich had to be rescheduled. I requested that they book me a flight with British Airways. I received a new ticket around 30 seconds later. Lufhansa will do the task if you follow their methods.
✅ Verified Review |  Going out to Funchal was a memorable experience due to service minded staff and really good food. Going back was somewhat different, as staff seemed tired, and the fact that Economy class stewards were in charge of Business class when the business class FA were having a break. Pushing the Cabin Attendant button did not make anyone come. Two very different experiences. No IFE was provided on the four hour flights between Funchal and Frankfurt, which is not good enough. However, there was an entertainment App available, but you need to download it before taking off. It's not available for Windows Phone, and when you get informed about the App, it's too late to install it, as flight mode is required, which to me makes no sense. Altogether Lufthansa still sticks to the Business Class concept, although there is room for improvement. Despite some minor twitches, we were very satisfied about the service.;The four-hour journey from Funchal to Frankfurt had no in-flight entertainment. When the business class FA was taking a break, the economy class stewards took over.  while there is potential for development and improvement, the service was very satisfactory.
Due to the strike on 29th Nov, Lufthansa cancelled my flight. I had to rebook a flight at a lot of inconvenience at short notice. In the meantime, I have been on hold for over an hour and given up, and tried their email feedback form in order to claim my refund. Why when Lufthansa cancelled the flight, they cannot automatically refund my money is beyond me (other than to keep my money as their process is too long and difficult so people give up) and I have enough to do because of their cancellation at the last minute. ;Due to the strike on November 29th, Lufthansa cancelled my flight. I had to rebook a flight on short notice, which was really inconvenient. I was on wait for over an hour before giving up and used their email feedback form to request my refund.
✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Los Angeles with Lufthansa on an A380 aircraft. The service onboard was quite good, the meals were also good (except maybe the salad). The onboard entertainment system was full of recent films and series. No problem with the screen or even the sound system. The seat was a bit hard for my back, but the same as most Economy cabins on European airlines. The Wifi wasn't working most of the time.;The onboard entertainment system was stocked with new movies and television shows. Wifi was intermittently unavailable. The seat was a little uncomfortable for my back. The service was quite good.
✅ Verified Review |  A return flight from Manchester to Bucharest via Munich with first ticket simple economy, and the second full economy (paid more because was expecting some difficulties with my family and needed to be able to cancel the ticket). Used the first ticket successfully. On the second ticket re-booked 3 times (because of rebooking paid additional 100GBP). In the end understood I'll not be able to make it so asked the refund for the return ticket. Was told that I'll receive my money in 2 weeks. After 2 weeks was told to wait for another week. After that week was told that I should've bought both tickets with economy full in order to be able to get a refund. I bought the return ticket specifically more expensive to be able to cancel it. That's unacceptable.;The return trip from Manchester to Bucharest goes through Munich. The first ticket is a simple economy ticket, and the second is a complete economy ticket. The second ticket was rebooked three times. The did not refund.
✅ Verified Review |  Lisbon to Bangkok via Frankfurt, sat in main cabin to BKK in new Boeing 747-8 and upper deck back to FRA in older Boeing 747-400. Great new cabin, comfortable seats (slept 6 hours), quality, fresh food nicely presented, very friendly service of the crew, and informative pilots. A nice entertainment system.  The only negative of the trip for which LH is not responsible is the poor boarding procedure in BKK: no info on time of boarding, and all classes boarding at same time. Price for business, I paid 2300EUR from LIS return ticket which is very reasonable.;the new cabin, comfy seats, quality, fresh and tasty meal, and very helpful personnel service. In BKK, the boarding procedure is poor: all classes board at the same time. The business class ticket price is pretty fair.
Frankfurt to Tehran in Lufthansa Premium Economy. For an almost 5 hour flight its quite comfortable. Seats are wider than normal economy, plenty of leg space, good monitors for the IFE. Food is same than economy but served on porcelain instead of plastic. Both flights have been in time, Crew was friendly, food was ok, IFE improve a lot compared to the past. I have critisised Lufthansa a lot in the past, this time nothing to complain and even price was in the range. For this routing and in this class worth to fly with them.;It's extremely comfy for an almost 5-hour travel. Seats are broader than standard economy, with enough of leg room and decent IFE monitors. Food is the same as in the economy. The service was fine.
Tunis to New York JFK via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. Huge check-in line in TUN but an airport official let us go in the business class check-in. The flight is expected to leave at 12:00 and later they announce that the flight will be delayed until 12:40. Naturally I was stressed because we only had a 1:40 minute transfer in FRA. We board the plane, crew are very friendly. We take-off as expected (12:40). The food was fine but there was not much of it (just a ham sandwich). We land after a 2 hours of flying and with only a 6 minute delay. The transfer was quick. We board our flight for JFK on-time and we take-off on time. The food was good and plenty of snacks. The entertainment was good. Shortly before landing, pizza as well as drinks are served. And even closer to landing we are served chocolate milk and chocolate. The flight attendants were very nice. I recommend Lufthansa.;Lufthansa flies from Tunis to New York JFK via Frankfurt. There was a long check-in line in TUN, but we could easily board in business class. The food tasted good, but there it was not enough. The crew were nice and helpful.
✅ Verified Review |  Oslo to San Francisco via Frankfurt.  This is the second time I travel with Lufthansa, and it's been a great experience. I travelled economy class, and the legroom, the seat recline, food and the amenities in general were just superb. They offered us water and snacks, plus the meals. The best economy class I've used, better than Air France in long-haul flights. The A380 is a great plane as well.;The Lufthansa A380 is an excellent airliner for long-distance flights. Economy class is the nicest I've ever been in, even better than Air France on long-haul flights.
Flew Lufthansa from Lima to Frankfurt. Gate was a bit too small for the pax load and boarding was delayed by 20 mins. I reserved a seat with extra space and it was great value for money. Cabin was clean and FAs well presented. Take off was delayed for almost an hour due ATC. It's overnight flight so dinner was served promptly after take off and lights switched off soon after tables were cleared. I slept for about 7h and extra leg room helped the experience quite a lot. Manged to watch a movie at the beginning and another at the end of the flight. I like Lufthansa's IFE as it is not focused only on commercial entertainment with music section being my favorite. Light breakfast was served 2h before landing. We landed with 30min delay but it did not affect my connecting flight with another company. Another quality experience with Lufthansa.;The cabin was spotless, and the FAs were well-presented. The gate was too narrow for the passenger load, thus boarding was delayed by 20 minutes. ATC caused a nearly hour-long delay in takeoff. Dinner was served promptly after takeoff. The IFE was good.
✅ Verified Review | Budapest to Manchester via Munich with Lufthansa. Beware with certain types of economy ticket, you will be asked to pay to check in luggage. I flew from Manchester to Budapest with Brussels Airlines and a piece of checked-in luggage was included in the price. However, on the way back, the same did not apply with Lufthansa. As I did not book the flight for myself, I was unaware of this. If you're flying a full-service airline, such as Lufthansa, you can at least expect not to have to pay for one piece of checked-in luggage. Otherwise, what's the point of paying so much more for a ticket when you can fly with Ryanair or easyjet?. It seems this policy has been introduced this year as I have flown many times with Lufthansa and never had this experience before.;Certain types of economy tickets will require you to check in your bags. If you're flying a full-service airline, you shouldn't have to pay for anything.
✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to New York JFK with Lufthansa. Pleasant flight on the whole. Flight departed and landed on time. We had priority boarding, which was nice. Seat was nice and comfy. IFE provided plenty of films, although the screen was difficult to deal with. Food was okay (just owing to the fact that I dislike Camembert cheese). Crew was polite and good in doing their service, but not excellent as our last crew on the 747 has been. Aeroplane was clean on the whole. It was an amazing experience to fly on the A380.;Lufthansa provided a pleasant journey. Although the screen was challenging to cope with, IFE gave a good selection of films. The food was satisfactory. The crew was courteous and efficient in their work.
"Prague to Hamburg via Frankfurt. Very pleasant experience. The flights were on time and the crews were very pleasant including making funny but still appropriate announcements. A snack and free beverages were served which is adequate for those short flights. Lufthansa serves Warsteiner which is probably one of the best beers in Germany. In addition I got a really good deal for the ticket. Can't complain about the legroom; however the flight attendants; especially on the PRG-FRA leg have to be more willing to speak English as almost nobody onboard was German.";The Lufthansa flights from Prague to Hamburg via Frankfurt were on schedule, and the crews were friendly. Fodd and beverage servings were fine and enough. The flight attendants should be more willing to communicate in English.
Hamburg to Prague via Frankfurt. Got a really good deal on Lufthansa. The flights were comfortable with decent leg room and an adequate on-board service. Both flights were delayed and the crews/gate personnel were making excuses for the delay. Apparently the plane arrived late from FRA. It's been standing at the gate for at least 30 minutes. Otherwise friendly flight attendants and I still made my connection. Their inflight magazine featured some nice articles but could do with less advertisements.;I got a great price with Lufthansa. flights were comfortable but delayed without explanation. Their in-flight magazine had some interesting content but could have used fewer adverts.
✅ Verified Review |  Montreal to Sarajevo via Munich. Lufthansa impresses me and makes me feel welcomed, ranging from its varied In-flight Entertainment system to its superb Customer Service both on the ground and in the air. I have flown numerous times on Lufthansa long-hauls and short-hauls and on every flight I've been on the cabin crew service ranged from good to exceptional. Their ground staff ranged from grumpy and cold (we're all humans after all) to exceptional, with some who had even gone way out of the way to ensure that I was looked after (particularly in Munich). In-flight entertainment system is multi-lingual, more than you'd expect. ;Lufthansa amazes and welcomes me, from its In-Flight Entertainment system to its excellent Customer Service both on the ground and in the air. Their ground crew ranges from grumpy and frigid to amazing.
✅ Verified Review |  Route was Houston to Frankfurt return on October 13th and 17th. Service was superb and the A380 First class on Lufthansa is always a delight for First Class Travel.

In flight entertainment selection good.;Lufthansa A380 First Class is always a pleasure to fly in. The amenities were excellent as well as the staff. The food was delicious, and the choices was extensive.
Frankfurt to Buenos Aires. I booked flight in economy class and then used miles to upgrade it to Premium Economy as my booking class did not allow me upgrade to business. Flight was overbooked and gate agents asked for volunteers to fly tomorrow for money compensation. When trying to pass ticket scanner my ticket was rejected and I had to report to gate agent who surprised me with a new seat in business class. I think I was upgraded due my loyalty i.e by using miles for upgrade. FRA to EZE is the longest LH flight (almost 14 hours) and it was great to be in good seat, served nice food and drinks by wonderful attentive FA who made me feel like a guest, not just a passenger. It was one of those flights when you would not mind to last a little bit longer.;The flight was overbooked. The experience was wonderful with comfortable seating, good food and drinks, and fantastic FA.
✅ Verified Review | It's a pity Lufthansa handed over almost all European routes to Eurowings (except for those out of Frankfurt and Munich), because it's a great airline also on short domestic hops. Good legroom in the very quiet A320neo. Efficient service since you get handed over a chocolate bar at the entrance, so the crew only has to serve drinks. They're happy to serve you more than one drink. Took of half an hour late, but landed only 10 mins behind schedule. Apologies from the cockpit. My favourite airline.;Legroom is adequate and service is efficient. Good foods and drinks served. My favourite airline!
✅ Verified Review |  Bucharest to Madrid via Frankfurt,  and Valencia to Bucharest via Frankfurt. Four short flights, 2 hrs. approx. each. The most important thing was that all flights were on time and uneventful. The planes were clean and seemed to be in good technical situation. Enough legroom for a medium tall (1.75 m) passenger as I am. Cabin crew and ground staff were polite and efficient. The food was quite poor (better on FRA-MAD leg), sandwiches just edible. Fortunately they kept Warsteiner in their offer. No inflight entertainment and the announcements from cockpit difficult to understand. All in all, a good product, decent priced (223 EUR/pers for four flights). Due to Lufthansa's connections at their hubs in Frankfurt and Munich, this airline remains a solid option to travel from Bucharest to other destinations.;All planes were on time. Legroom is adequate. The cabin crew and ground crew were both courteous and efficient. Food was substandard. A good product overall.
✅ Verified Review |  I was flying from Mumbai (BOM) - Frankfurt (FRA) with Lufthansa and an onward codeshare flight to Toronto. This was my first experience with Lufthansa and I really enjoyed the experience. I could recline the seat nicely. I was well fed with a delicious 3-course dinner and breakfast meals during the flight. The selection of movies was great. Cabin staff were generous, polite and friendly. My overall experience in Lufthansa was excellent.;comfortable seat, good food, thanks to a fantastic three-course dinner and breakfast. The movie selection was excellent. The staff very kind and courteous.
✅ Verified Review |  Brussels to Malta via Munich. Both flight from start to finish were excellent, the flight to Munich departed on time excellent cabin service good choice of refreshments offered. Although the aircraft was over 26 years old it certainly did not show its age. The second leg was on an A320 less than 3 months old. The same excellent level of service given. On time arrivals on both legs. An excellent level of service, would certainly use Lufthansa again.;Both flights were perfect, with on time departure. Although the airplane was old, it was wll-maintained. An excellent service experience.
Flew from London to Seoul via Frankfurt and back. Both legs of the journey had short change over times and both times the flight was delayed, meaning a stressful sprint across one side of the terminal to another. Onboard, there were plenty of drinks being offered and the cabin crew were friendly and approachable. Only downsides were the hard, flat seats and the boring entertainment options (only 3 Korean movies were offered even though 95% of the passengers were Korean. I noticed others were bored too). I sat near the toilets and never saw a flight attendant cleaning the toilets, which were dirty towards the end. Overall, it is excellent value for money, cheaper than other competitors served by excellent cabin crew.;Superb value for money, less expensive than competitors and serviced by excellent cabin crew. The disadvantages were hard, flat seats and uninteresting entertainment alternatives.
✅ Verified Review |  The flight from Frankfurt to Rome FCO was an all-round solid experience. We flew aboard a very new (2015) A320-200 with sharklets. Unfortunately the weather was not that great so we experienced some turbulence. LH European business class seats are the same as those in economy but with a free middle seat. I am not too tall so I don't mind them, as they are quite comfortable and have a very supporting firm backrest. I always try to sit in the first row so legroom was no problem. The foldout table mounted to the bulkhead is a nice touch and very spacious. The food was good (a salade nicoise and a dessert), adequate for the time of the day (5pm) but a little more could be expected, as everything looks a little bland. The purser, however, was very attentive and friendly. I really like the Lufthansa  colour scheme as it gives the whole plane a classy look. The complete lack of IFE puzzles me however and I really miss the air show that allows me to follow the route. All in all a solid product and good value for money if you also factor in the possibility to access the FRA business class lounge.;The Lufthansa trip from Frankfurt to Rome FCO was an excellent overall experience. When you consider the FRA business class lounge, you get a good deal. I'm perplexed by the lack of IFE.
✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Chicago, and Lufthansa is always top-notch. Easy, friendly, competent check-in staff and friendly, classy, gracious in flight staff. The food is tasty, they don't nickel and dime you for an adult beverage, and instead of giving you a sour puss liked United, they always smile warmly. Also, unlike United, after they serve you a drink and your meal they don't disappear in the galley behinda curtain to consult their bid sheets. They come around every 1/2 hour or so with a tray of orange juice and water and don't scowl when you go to the galley for another drink. They do everything right.;the check-in was easy and the staff was competent and helpul. The cuisine is delicious.
Flew from Rzeszow to Newark via Munich. Flight from Rzeszow to Munich, only 1 hour, was pretty uneventful. Free sandwich and drink. Very small plane, and as a 6 foot tall man, I barely fit in the cabin. The crew was very nice, and spoke fluent English with Polish greetings at the beginning and end of the flight. Flight from Munich to Newark was also phenomenal. Economy class is just like any other, nothing to write home about. The food was delicious, and the service was superb. The A340 is a very comfortable aircraft with a nice feature: the bathrooms are downstairs. We landed 45 minutes earlier, and the transfer was easy. I have been flying with Lufthansa for 4 years now, and it is always easier to fly with them through Frankfurt or Munich rather than drive to JFK just to fly with LOT. Recommend for anyone looking for a safe and reliable trip.;The Lufthansa A340 is a highly pleasant plane with a unique feature: the bathrooms are located below. The staff was friendly and spoke English fluently. Economy class is basically like any other.
"✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Warsaw return with Lufthansa. Got a cheap ticket during holiday season. Great value for the price I paid. All flights were on time, cabin was clean and well maintained, even in the old B737. Cabin crew was nice and attentive. Best was the catering, LH offered a salmon sandwich and 2 drink rounds on this short flight including free alcoholic beverages. Only negative aspect was the check in at Frankfurt airport. Ground staff forced me to use automated bag drop although I let them know that I wanted to use bag drop with ""real"" staff. On my return flight bag drop was handled by a friendly employee.";Excellent value for the money. All flights were on time, and the cabin was clean and well-kept, even on the ancient B737. The cabin crew was pleasant and attentive.
✅ Verified Review |  Zurich to Beijing via Frankfurt. The only bad thing about this routing was the check in by the handling agent Swiss in Zurich. Unfriendly, taking us away a slightly (we speak about 1cm) too big hand luggage for making extra money while sending it empty to Beijing as checked bag. On the short hop to Frankfurt they served a Beer. The premium Economy Class Cabin on the A380 is on the lower deck in front of the plane. You have your separate cabin, looks like a Business Class in the old days. To start they brought fresh juice, followed after take of with the Menu Card and nuts and sparkling wine. 2 menus to choose from and very well presented on China with metal cutlery and a real glas for wine. 2 different white and red wine to choose. Meal from Frankfurt was extremely good. Crew was professional and attentively. IFE is good with a selection of German movies, Leg room is sufficient, only a little bit difficult to move from middle or window seat to the aisle. Seat is comfortable. I recommend Lufthansa Premium Economy Class.;The A380's Premium Economy Class cabin is located on the lowest deck in front of the plane. There are two menus to pick from. Leg room is enough, staff professional and good IFE.
San Francisco to Bologna via Frankfurt. Excellent airline and polite staff. We feel that passenger safety is their priority which they have proven on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, they should do something about their partner airlines whose professionalism is not as high. On the San Francisco Airport, the staff of their partner airline didn't want to let our 12 year old son into the Senator Lounge because a Gold membership card allows only one guest. They asked us to pay $59 for him to enter for only 1 hour (the time we had before our flight to Frankfurt) which we okayed. As if $59 was not enough they said that our MasterCard didn't have any money on it (not true) and on top of it all didn't want to accept cash. So they turned us away. This has never happened to us before. We were allowed to go into every single lounge around the world without paying an extra fee for our son. Bad image for Star Alliance indeed.;Passenger safety is their top priority. The personnel of their partner airline refused to admit our 12-year-old son enter the Senator Lounge at San Francisco International Airport because a Gold membership card only allowed one guest. However, airlie in itself is fabulous and staff is professional.
